<p>This place was right across the street from the site of the Valentine’s Day Massacre and might have even played a roll.</p>
<p>The food is oversized and delicious. Their “pizza pot pies” are exactly what they sound like. They line a ceramic bowl with cheese and fill it with your sauce (meat or veggie) and toppings choices. I went all the way with Boston butt sausage, whole mushrooms, peppers, and more. They then take the dough and top the bowl, letting it cover the sides and bake it. Table side they flip the whole thing and remove the bowl presenting the pot pie pizza. It’s delicious.</p>
<p>Their other stable are the oven grinders, or gigantic sandwiches. These subs are 11&#8243; long and must be at least 4&#8243; wide and weigh a ton. We went with the Italian ham that was served with a swiss cheese and a pile of green peppers. It was great.</p>
<p>Needless to say there were plenty of leftovers.</p>

<p><strong>On the Road in Chicago: The Little Goat</strong></p>
<p>This place is a hip, modern diner that serves Asian &#8211; American hybrid diner food. It’s run by a Top Chef winner and features dishes with goat meat. Since you don’t see that many places, I figured I had to try. I had a sloppy joe made with goat, an Asian slaw, and homemade brioche bun. Pretty good.</p>
<p>Carla had a “breakfast pasta” which was a giant floating egg with noodles and seafood. And bacon. And cheese. It’s basically everything she loves in this world.</p>
<p>And since there was macaroni and cheese on the menu it had to be ordered. This is super creamy, super rich, delicious stuff.</p>

<p><strong>On the Road in Chicago: Rocket Burger Bar</strong></p>
<p>Saw this place on the Food Network and had to try it. It’s right next to Wrigley Field and features some serious burger options.</p>
<p>I went with the Locavore which touts locally sourced beef, smoked cheese, super fancy onion rings (the waitress said they come laid out in a donut box), bacon aioli, and a pretzel bun. Really freaking good. The onion rings were extremely crisp and the pretzel bun was actually soft in the middle. Plus the smoked cheese added a great bite.</p>
<p>Carla has the Rocket Burger which is made with wagyu beef, brie cheese, date jam aioli, mushrooms, and a red onion brioche bun. Crazy delicious stuff. As expected, this burger is extremely decadent and comes with truffle oil fries.</p>

<p>Meat week wraps up here at Chow Down Orlando with a sandwich featuring classic filet mignon!</p>
<p>Louie’s Bistro, one of our favorite food trucks here in town, featured this amazing sandwich recently. It’s perfectly cooked filet topped with onions, mushrooms, and a homemade béarnaise sauce. The flavors in this sandwich, combined with the quality of the meat, took this sandwich to the level of greatness.</p>
<p>As always, you can fine <a href="http://twitter.com/LouiesBistro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Louie’s Bistro on twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Part two of beef week takes us to <a href="http://bbjunction.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">B &amp; B Junction</a> on Fairbanks in the former 4 Rivers location next to Skycraft. B &amp; B touts a farm to table burger experience. The beef used on this particular day came from a farm in St. Cloud. Pretty cool stuff.</p>
<p>The burgers, as you can see, are on another level. Featured at the top is the #5, a burger with house-made bourbon ham, pecan-smoked bacon, over-easy fried farm egg, and brie on brioche french toast. Topped with a little powdered sugar. This burger is on another level. It’s a Monte Cristo, but it’s not. It’s a burger, but it’s not. It&#8217;s delicious.</p>
<p>Also pictured is the #2, a burger with pecan-smoked bacon, aged cheddar, caramelized onion jam, lettuce and tomato. This is more your standard bacon cheeseburger but the caramelized onion jam take it to a place of esteem.</p>
<p>Fried pickles and onion rings round out or pictures. Just know that when the menu says the plates are “for the table,” they mean it. Five us us had trouble finishing 4 plates of fries, rings, and fried pickles that were “for the table.”</p>
<p>The quality of the ingredients mixed with the amazing taste puts B &amp; B Junction at the top of our burger list here in town.</p>
<p>Really delicious stuff.</p>

<p>Today is the beginning of beef week here at Chow Down Orlando. We’ll feature three great meals featuring good old beef. Today we look at the special burger for the month at Hamburger Mary’s in Downtown Orlando, the Nutter Butter.</p>
<p>This, like all of their burgers, is a half pound beef patty but this bad boy is topped with a sweet peanut butter and crunchy potato chips. At the waiter suggestion, I also added bananas and bacon to complete the Elvis inspired masterpiece. Oddly enough, all of these flavors and textures work really well together. The burger was pretty delicious.</p>
<p>Being that it’s the burger of the month, I’d venture down to Hamburger Mary’s before the end of August to take advantage of this strange concoction. You’ll be happy you did.</p>

<p><a href="http://muchoorlando.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mucho Tequila and Tacos</a> sits in Downtown Orlando and has a large variety of tacos on the menu. Pictured are the Black and White (if I remember correctly) which was a blackened mahi taco and the Al Pastor, which is marinated pork with pineapple and all the other fixings.</p>
<p>The Al Pastor taco was roughly $4 and the fish taco was pushing $8. When I asked about the large price difference, the waitress told me that the speciality tacos, which the mahi one was part of, were much larger than the normal tacos. So it justified the price difference to me. However, as you can see in the picture, they are the same size. Don’t get me wrong, the taco was good, but it was in no way worth $8.</p>
<p>What was well worth the price, however, was the corn appetizer: Mucho Massa. This is seasoned and flame grilled corn that packs just the right amount of kick. It’s delicious.</p>
<p>If you end up at Mucho, remember that despite the larger price, all the tacos are the same size.</p>
