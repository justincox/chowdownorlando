<p>This place was right across the street from the site of the Valentine’s Day Massacre and might have even played a roll.</p>
<p>The food is oversized and delicious. Their “pizza pot pies” are exactly what they sound like. They line a ceramic bowl with cheese and fill it with your sauce (meat or veggie) and toppings choices. I went all the way with Boston butt sausage, whole mushrooms, peppers, and more. They then take the dough and top the bowl, letting it cover the sides and bake it. Table side they flip the whole thing and remove the bowl presenting the pot pie pizza. It’s delicious.</p>
<p>Their other stable are the oven grinders, or gigantic sandwiches. These subs are 11&#8243; long and must be at least 4&#8243; wide and weigh a ton. We went with the Italian ham that was served with a swiss cheese and a pile of green peppers. It was great.</p>
<p>Needless to say there were plenty of leftovers.</p>

<p><strong>On the Road in Chicago: The Little Goat</strong></p>
<p>This place is a hip, modern diner that serves Asian &#8211; American hybrid diner food. It’s run by a Top Chef winner and features dishes with goat meat. Since you don’t see that many places, I figured I had to try. I had a sloppy joe made with goat, an Asian slaw, and homemade brioche bun. Pretty good.</p>
<p>Carla had a “breakfast pasta” which was a giant floating egg with noodles and seafood. And bacon. And cheese. It’s basically everything she loves in this world.</p>
<p>And since there was macaroni and cheese on the menu it had to be ordered. This is super creamy, super rich, delicious stuff.</p>

<p><strong>On the Road in Chicago: Rocket Burger Bar</strong></p>
<p>Saw this place on the Food Network and had to try it. It’s right next to Wrigley Field and features some serious burger options.</p>
<p>I went with the Locavore which touts locally sourced beef, smoked cheese, super fancy onion rings (the waitress said they come laid out in a donut box), bacon aioli, and a pretzel bun. Really freaking good. The onion rings were extremely crisp and the pretzel bun was actually soft in the middle. Plus the smoked cheese added a great bite.</p>
<p>Carla has the Rocket Burger which is made with wagyu beef, brie cheese, date jam aioli, mushrooms, and a red onion brioche bun. Crazy delicious stuff. As expected, this burger is extremely decadent and comes with truffle oil fries.</p>

<p>The final stop on our north Florida diner tour isn’t exactly a diner. Though it is found in north Florida and it’s a local diner-like place. It’s <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/lucas-orange-park" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luca’s Italian</a> in Orange Park.</p>
<p>Luca’s offers some amazing Italian favorites, including pizza, calzones, hot subs, etc. Pictured are the Luca’s Special (sausage, pepperoni, onions, green peppers, and mushrooms) with added pineapple and a fried eggplant with spinach and mushroom. If you’ve never had fried eggplant on a pizza before, go to Luca’s and give it a try. It’s amazing.</p>
<p>Continuing our diner theme, the pricing at Luca’s is old school. Monday through Saturday Luca’s has a “lunch special&#8221; where each slice of pizza is $1. These are giant slices too. The pictures don’t give them justice. Two slices and I was stuffed.</p>
<p>If you ever find yourself in Orange Park, stop by Luca’s for lunch and try eggplant on your pizza. You’ll be very happy you did.</p>
<p>Luca’s Italian is in Orange Park on Blanding Blvd.</p>

<p>The second stop on our north Florida diner tour is Angel’s Dining Car in Palatka. Like Powell’s the other day, Angel’s is a classic diner featuring curbside service and outdoor picnic tables. But Angel’s is something more, it’s actually an old fashioned dining car turned into stationary restaurant. A step inside the dining car feels like a step back in time.</p>
<p>Angel’s has been open since 1939 and features classic diner food like milkshakes, great burgers and onion rings, but also has some unique features like the Black Bottom (pictured with the blue toothpick).</p>
<p>The Black Bottom is hamburger meat, egg, and bacon cooked into a hamburger patty shape to create the ultimate breakfast/lunch hybrid burger. Like Powell’s, Angel’s amazing food comes with prices from days gone by. The Swiss Burger combo pictured, which came with fries and onion rings, was comparable to a combo meal at a fast food place. And considering the quality is far better than any fast food place, you’d be hard pressed not to stop at Angel’s if in the area.</p>
<p>Angel’s Dining Car can be found in Palatka on Reid St.</p>

<p>This week is the North Florida Diner Tour here at Chow Down Orlando. We hit the back roads and visited some of the local gems in some of the small towns north of Orlando. If you find yourself looking for some day trips, there’s some great food to be had.</p>
<p>The first on the tour is <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/powells-dairy-freeze-starke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Powell’s Dairy Freeze</a> in Starke. Powell’s is a classic “dairy freeze” in that there is a walk up window and some picnic tables outside. They also offer curbside service like all classic Americana diners.</p>
<p>While at Powell’s, I tried a banana shake and a “Super Burger.” The shake was real ice cream and chunks of banana. It perfectly made. The “Super Burger” was everything a great diner burger should be: two hand-pressed patties cooked on the flattop, cheese, onion, lettuce, and hand sliced tomato, with some “super” sauce. It was great.</p>
<p>The flavors in the burger and shake were spot on delicious. But when you consider the old school pricing at Powell’s, they’re even better. The shake and burger were under $6. A downright steal.</p>
<p>Powell’s is a true American diner and can be found in Starke on North Temple Ave.</p>

<p>Recently Carla and I found ourselves in downtown Richmond, VA for a wedding. Less than a blocks walk from our hotel was the <a href="http://theurbanfarmhouse.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Urban Farmhouse</a> where we ended up eating breakfast both mornings we were in town and is the latest <a href="/tagged/on-the-road" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On the Road</a> feature for Chow Down Orlando.</p>
<p>Urban Farmhouse is a very cool organic and locally sourced coffee house, market, and cafe. We opted for their special holiday brunch scramble menu, having a combination of the local egg and havarti cheese scramble each morning. One included Virginia ham and the other included soy sausage. Both had rosemary and other great seasonings on the eggs and were served with fresh, local baked bread and sliced apples and pears.</p>
<p>So, the next time you happen to find yourself in Downtown Richmond, make sure to find the Urban Farmhouse and give it a try.</p>
