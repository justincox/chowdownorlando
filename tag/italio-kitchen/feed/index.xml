<a href='http://chowdownorlando.com/2013/06/this-is-italio-kitchen-which-has-recently-opened/attachment/200/'><img width="250" height="250" src="http://chowdownorlando.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tumblr_mnqaoyAwzU1r1ujdyo1_1280-250x250.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>

<p>This is <a href="http://italiokitchen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Italio Kitchen</a> which has recently opened in Winter Park. Think of it as the Chipotle of Italian food.</p>
<p>When you enter you pick your pasta (wheat or flour), your meat (sausage, chicken, beef, or veggie), your sauce (alfredo, tomato, or a few different kinds of pesto), and then all of your toppings. As you work your way down the line the bowl gets more and more full and then you pay and eat.</p>
<p>I tried the flour pasta with sausage, alfredo and tomato sauces, and added in red peppers, a brushetta mix, and topped with shaved parmesan. It was really good. And for the price (about $7), it was a ton of food and quite a good value.</p>
<p>I think Italio can do well as there really isn’t a fast-casual Italian place here in Orlando. It is a chain, but a local one that seems to have it’s ducks in a row. I can see these popping up all over the place.</p>
