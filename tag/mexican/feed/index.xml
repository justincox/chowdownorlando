<p><a href="http://muchoorlando.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mucho Tequila and Tacos</a> sits in Downtown Orlando and has a large variety of tacos on the menu. Pictured are the Black and White (if I remember correctly) which was a blackened mahi taco and the Al Pastor, which is marinated pork with pineapple and all the other fixings.</p>
<p>The Al Pastor taco was roughly $4 and the fish taco was pushing $8. When I asked about the large price difference, the waitress told me that the speciality tacos, which the mahi one was part of, were much larger than the normal tacos. So it justified the price difference to me. However, as you can see in the picture, they are the same size. Don’t get me wrong, the taco was good, but it was in no way worth $8.</p>
<p>What was well worth the price, however, was the corn appetizer: Mucho Massa. This is seasoned and flame grilled corn that packs just the right amount of kick. It’s delicious.</p>
<p>If you end up at Mucho, remember that despite the larger price, all the tacos are the same size.</p>

<p>This is the chimichanga from Wako Taco and it’s about the size of my head. I’m not even kidding. In that gigantic fried tortilla is everything you would ever want in a delicious tex-mex concoction including rice, pico, onions, cheese, peppers, pork al pastor, and more things that don’t come to memory. One thing was certain, it was delicious.</p>
<p>The size of it was so big that eating it with your hands was out of the question. This was a chimichanga that called for a fork. Not to mention a monster appetite. Seriously, for the price, this was an unexpected and delicious option from a taco truck.</p>
<p>Their menu sported all the other wonderful things you would expect from a good tex-mex truck, including taco bowls that have to been seen to believe. If you’re looking for stellar tex-mex in quantities that are out of this world, be sure to find the Wako Taco truck.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tijuanaflats.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tijuana Flats</a> is an Orlando staple. While it’s now a chain spreading quickly across the southeastern United States, it all started here in town when two UCF students had a dream. You can practically find a Tijuana in just about every neighborhood here in town, and frankly, that’s a good thing.</p>
<p>Pictured above are blackened chicken Dos Tacos. The tacos are great in their own right, but Tijuana provides a great option for deal seekers as well. On Tuesdays, this meal (including a drink), is only $4.99. Practically a steal. The tacos are good, especially if you go for the grilled option. If you’re not into tacos, just about everything on the menu is fantastic.</p>
<p>Be sure to check out Tijuana’s Taco Tuesday $4.99 promotion.</p>

<p>Gringos Locos! My absolute favorite place to get a burrito is at Loco Gringos downtown. The giant monstrosity you see in the picture is the mouth huger, which consists of rice, beans, cheese, eggs, chicken, and pico de gallo. But it’s so much more than all of your favorite Mexican-styled ingredients. It’s all your favorites done right and done deliciously.</p>
<p>Behind my almost-as-large-as-my-head-burrito you will see the nachos my friend Kelly had. I did not have the pleasure of trying one of these tasty treats because I was too busy stuffing my face with my burrito, but from her silent contentment I can only gather that they were exactly what she was looking for.</p>
<p>If your having a craving for Mexican, or just need some food in general, please check out the best burrito spot in Downtown Orlando: Gringos Locos!</p>

<p>A few weeks ago <a href="http://chowdownorlando.com/post/9670097964/ok-so-i-thought-of-another-great-restaurant-that-is" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anonymous suggested</a> we try Tacos el Rancho at the corner of Conway and Hoffner, right next to the McDonald’s. It’s taken a little while but we finally got over there and it’s time to share the results.</p>
<p>I’ve been to Tacos a few times in the past, though it was Carla’s first experience. The thing about Tacos is that you have to ignore the cheesy faux Mexican decor and the fact that it’s in a shopping center across from a McDonald’s. You ignore these first impressions because what you get at Tacos is really good, authentic food. Whenever you need to know at least a few words in Spanish in order to read the menu at a mexican restaurant, you know you’re in the right place.</p>
<p>I had the pastor (read marinated, cut pork) burrito and a chicken soft taco. Both had salsa, cheese, cilantro, onions, pico, and sour creme and the burrito also had black beans and rice. Both were very good. Both meats were a little over cooked, but were seasoned exceptionally.</p>
<p>Carla had pastor enchiladas with a side of rice and beans and a mango soda imported from Mexico. I don’t drink soda, but this was delicious. Nice and sweet.</p>
<p>When it comes to Mexican restaurants, for me it really comes down to the queso. I have a friend that believes if you have to pay for chips, the restaurant isn’t worth going to, and while you do have to pay for chips at Tacos el Rancho, it’s worth it to get to the queso. It’s a nice, creamy white queso that has just the right amount of heat with it’s peppers. The chips are good too, especially when you come across one that was sprinkled with lime juice.</p>
<p>Overall Tacos el Rancho is a really great Mexican restaurant here in Orlando and worth checking out if you’ve never been there.</p>
<p>Tacos el Rancho is at the corner of Conway and Hoffner right next to McDonald’s.</p>
