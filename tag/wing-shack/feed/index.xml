<p>The only thing better than college football on TV is the spread of college football food that gets prepared for the game. Last Saturday, when Florida State played Oklahoma, it was the perfect opportunity for some good college football food.</p>
<p>The headline act were wings from Wing Shack. It’s your basic, neighborhood wing joint that offers many different flavors of wings. They’ve got other food too, like burgers, sandwiches and salads and stuff, but why would you go to Wing Shack and get a salad? For the game Carla went with fried medium and I went grilled with half teriyaki and half bbq.</p>
<p>The wings are good. The bbq sauce used was nice and tangy. I’ve tired other flavors there and have to warn you to stay away from the honey bourbon, they’re pretty much awful. But pretty much everything else is good. Again, it’s your basic, neighborhood wing joint so you really can’t go wrong.</p>
<p>To supplement the wings, Carla prepared a multi-layer nacho dip, some onion rings and some celery and blue cheese, you know, for greenery.</p>
<p>Wing Shack is at the corner of Conway and Michigan.</p>
