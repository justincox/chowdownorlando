<p>As <a href="http://chowdownorlando.com/tagged/310" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we’ve stated before</a>, 310 Lakeside is one of our favorite places in Orlando. The food is wonderful and the atmosphere is great. It’s where we chose to have Easter brunch this year.</p>
<p>Pictured above were the two specials for Easter: A ham steak with sweet gravy, asparagus, and five cheese penne on top and biscuits with duck confit below. It’s safe to say 310 hit a home run with their Easter offerings.</p>
<p>In sampling the menu trying to decide what we wanted for our wedding reception, I’ve been able to enjoy most of the brunch menu at 310 and some of their lunch offerings as well. The Easter ham steak was one of the best things I’ve ordered from the restaurant. The ham was cooked perfectly and the sweet gravy – almost the flavor of warm caramel – was awesome. And really, what’s not to love about five cheese penne, or as the waiter called it, “grown up mac and cheese.”</p>
<p>310 Lakeside can be found at 310 Pine St in Downtown Orlando, right across from Lake Eola. They serve brunch on the weekends and lunch and dinner the rest of the week.</p>

<p>We went slightly untraditional for our wedding reception and chose to have brunch at 310 Lakeside, near Lake Eola. We chose this because breakfast is just so good and we thought it would be fun. Simply put, it was.</p>
<p>As part of our anniversary we went back to the scene of the crime, so to speak, and had to brunch at 310. The food there is delicious, so good in fact that we forgot to take pictures of most of it. Not pictured are the salmon omelet and the pear and brie omelet. The only thing left by the time we remembered to take pictures was the french toast. That’s ok though, because I like to save the best to be eaten last.</p>
<p>The french toast at 310 is so good. It’s french bread coated in crunchy cereal and just the right amount of powdered sugar. It’s some of the best french toast I’ve ever had.</p>
<p>310 Lakeside is located on Pine St, right across from Lake Eola. Brunch is served on weekends and they have a full menu the rest of the week.</p>
