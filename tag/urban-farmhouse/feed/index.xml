<p>Recently Carla and I found ourselves in downtown Richmond, VA for a wedding. Less than a blocks walk from our hotel was the <a href="http://theurbanfarmhouse.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Urban Farmhouse</a> where we ended up eating breakfast both mornings we were in town and is the latest <a href="/tagged/on-the-road" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On the Road</a> feature for Chow Down Orlando.</p>
<p>Urban Farmhouse is a very cool organic and locally sourced coffee house, market, and cafe. We opted for their special holiday brunch scramble menu, having a combination of the local egg and havarti cheese scramble each morning. One included Virginia ham and the other included soy sausage. Both had rosemary and other great seasonings on the eggs and were served with fresh, local baked bread and sliced apples and pears.</p>
<p>So, the next time you happen to find yourself in Downtown Richmond, make sure to find the Urban Farmhouse and give it a try.</p>
