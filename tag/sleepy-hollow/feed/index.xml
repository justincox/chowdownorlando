<p>A few weeks ago we visited Disney’s new Fantasyland and <a href="http://chowdownorlando.com/post/37127696933/last-week-we-found-ourselves-at-walt-disneys" target="_self">tried LeFou’s Brew</a>. That wasn’t the only thing we tasted that day while we were there. Another interesting purchase came from the Sleepy Hollow quick serve near the Hall of Presidents. The menu touted “waffle sandwiches” so we were interested.</p>
<p>This is the ham, swiss, and prosciutto waffle sandwich. It was very good. There was an herb aioli in the waffle squares and all that salty meat and cheese was a nice touch with the flakey waffle. Considering the typical picture of theme park food is a giant turkey leg, we thought this was a nice change of pace. It was very good.</p>
<p>The Sleepy Hollow also served up plenty of ice cream combinations onto of waffles, but that is for another time.</p>
