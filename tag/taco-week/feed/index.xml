<p><em>Today is the end of Taco Week here at Chow Down Orlando. It might be the end of the week, but it’s not the end of us eating tacos. Don’t forget to <a href="/ask" target="_blank" rel="noopener">submit your favorite taco places</a> for us to check out in the future!</em></p>
<p>These are the Pork Tacos from the <a href="http://5gastronomy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5 Gastronomy</a> food truck. They may look like your typical taco fare, but these babies take 48 hours to make. The pork is marinated for 48 hours before getting cooked to perfection. But the amazing pork that literally melts with each bite is not the only star of this show. There is so much amazing stuff in these small shells that each bite is a new explosion of flavor.</p>
<p>The tacos are listed to contain smoked corn purée, pickled onions, jicama cilantro salad, creme, and an avocado drizzle. All of these flavors seem like they’re portioned out so that each bite contains a new taste that combines wonderfully with the moist pork. These tacos are legit.</p>
<p>5 Gastronomy is a food track and can be <a href="http://twitter.com/5gastronomy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">followed on twitter</a>.</p>

<p><em>Today is day two of Taco Week here at Chow Down Orlando! This is the second of three taco centric reviews coming this week. Don’t forget to <a href="/ask" target="_blank" rel="noopener">submit your favorite taco places</a> for us to check out in the future!</em></p>
<p>If I were to tell you the picture above doesn’t actually contain grilled chicken, would you believe me? The tacos in question are the Tempeh Tacos at vegetarian friendly <a href="http://www.infusionorlando.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Infusion Tea</a> on Edgewater.</p>
<p>Tempeh is a soy product and, in these wonderful tacos, it’s the star of the show. The tacos are simply constructed with seasoned tempeh, black beans, and cabbage slaw but they pack a great flavor punch. They’re served with blue corn chips and fresh salsa.</p>
<p>As the name implies, Infusion Tea is primarily a tea house. Carla is the tea drinker and enjoys the large variety of flavors from around the globe while I enjoy the interesting menu options. While I’m not a vegetarian, I can enjoy a nice change in the menu from time to time.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a verity of teas or an extensive vegetarian menu, be sure to give Infusion Tea a try.</p>
<p>Infusion Tea can be found at 1600 Edgewater Dr.</p>
<p><em>Come back on Friday when Taco Week concludes with a pair of tacos that take 48 hours to make!</em></p>

<p><em>Today is the start of Taco Week here at Chow Down Orlando! This is the first of three taco centric reviews coming over the next few days. Don’t forget to <a href="/ask" target="_blank" rel="noopener">submit your favorite taco places</a> for us to check out in the future!</em></p>
<p>It’s kind of hard to make out any unique features from the five tacos, excuse me, <em>takos</em> pictured above with all the cilantro, onions, and cabbage lying about. But below all the green, purple and white lies the good stuff from Orlando’s newest taco house, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tako-Cheena-by-Pom-Pom/174918999187662" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tako Cheena</a>.</p>
<p>Tako Cheena opened a few months back and is run by the fine folks from Pom Pom’s Tea House. They offer a number of unique taco options for all different taste preferences. Carla and I decided to sample five of the seven taco options. From the “House Tako” menu we sampled Thai Peanut Chicken, Indian Yellow Curry with Crispy Tofu, and Asian Braised Beef. From the “Specialty Tako” menu we went with Panko Crusted Cod and Chinese BBQ Char Siu Pork Belly.</p>
<p>I’ll be blunt, skip the House Tako’s all together and stick with the Specialties. The house options aren’t bad, they just don’t leave much of an impact nor carry much in the way of flavor. On the other hand, the Specialty Takos, especially the Panko Crusted Cod, take tacos to a whole other level. Specifically, the Panko Crusted Cod is one of the best taco options in Orlando. The flavors mixed with the crispy fish makes for a very enjoyable experience. So good, I had to order a second.</p>
<p>You can find Tako Cheena by Pom Pom at 932 Mills Ave.</p>
<p><em>Check back into Taco Week on Wednesday when we look at tacos from a place you might not expect.</em></p>
