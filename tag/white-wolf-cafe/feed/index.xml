<p>The <a href="http://www.whitewolfcafe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">White Wolf Cafe</a> is in the antique district near Lake Ivanhoe. Many people have told us we need to check it out, and this morning we finally got over there. We now know why everyone has been telling us to try this place. Simply put: it’s amazing!</p>
<p>We started off with what White Wolf calls the best cinnamon buns in the universe. It did not disappoint and as far as breakfast appetizer go, it’s not to be missed.</p>
<p>Carla had the chicken and waffles. The massive panko breaded chicken breast sat atop a huge belgin waffle. The whole thing was topped with two fried eggs and came with hashbrowns. The chicken was delicious and, with a generous portion of honey covering the whole thing, was a great meal.</p>
<p>I had the special of the day, the five sausage omelet. The crazy-sized three-egg omelet was filled with huge chunks of chorizo, smoked, beef, pork, and turkey sausages and covered with provolone. It came with a super-dense homemade biscuit that was incredible and home fries. The omelet was was out of this world good. Like, beyond amazing good.</p>
<p>While it took us quite some time to finally get over to White Wolf, I don’t suppose it will be long before we are back again.</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="http://www.whitewolfcafe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">White Wolf Cafe</a> on Orange Ave near Lake Ivanhoe in the antique district.</p>
