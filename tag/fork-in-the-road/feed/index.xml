<p>Fork in the Road has stepped up their game since the last time I visited them. Then it was just quality desserts and some sandwiches, but now the fare is on another level and, according to the menu board, Fork in the Road is the Best Gourmet Food Truck for 2013. The menu was intriguing with a lot of unique options, but what stood out most to me was the American Kobe Beef Corn Dog.</p>
<p>Essentially it’s exactly what it sounds like, a large, quality beef hot dog encased in a type of batter and fried. It was served with a pink mustard that had a sweetness (I’m guessing from whatever colored the mustard pink) that gave the mustard a pretty unique flavor.</p>
<p>All in all it was a pretty good corn dog as far as corn dogs go. You can find <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EatForkInTheRoad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fork in the Road on Facebook</a>.</p>

<p>When I first came upon Fork in the Road, I was almost overwhelmed with the extent of their menu. There were so many options that sounded great, it was hard to decide what to eat. There was pulled pork to macaroni and cheese pops to beef tongue. I ended up selecting the 72-hour marinated pork belly bánh mi sandwich.</p>
<p>The sandwich was good, not fantastic, but good. The bread, which is the same for all of their sandwiches, was a little too hard and thick for my taste and took away from pork belly and slaw inside. It also was relatively overpriced for what was presented.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the menu didn’t stop at sandwiches. There were almost an equal number of amazing sounding desserts that ranged from homemade whoopee pies to Elvis inspired cookie and ice cream sandwiches to what is pictured above: the peanut butter cup on steroids.</p>
<p>Like the sandwich, the dessert price is high, however here it was worth every single penny. When it comes from the truck, all that can be seen above the foil container is a layer of chocolate and a small Reese’s cup. But upon digging in, there’s layer after layer of goodness. At the base of the cup is a thick chocolate cookie with a layer of solid chocolate. Above that is a thick layer of very smooth peanut butter which is followed by a chocolate mouse and the chocolate topping that’s visible at the beginning. Every bite of this thing is so good.</p>
<p>If you see Fork in the Road then my advice is to skip the sandwiches and go straight for the dessert.</p>
