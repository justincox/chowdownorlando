<p><a href="http://4rsmokehouse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4Rivers Smokehouse</a> might just be a staple on this site. I can’t say it enough, if you haven’t eaten at 4Rivers then stop what you’re doing and go get in the line. It’s amazing and you’ll be happy you waited.</p>
<p>Typically while at 4R I pick up the Texas Destroyer (brisket, cheese and jalapeños) or the surprisingly delicious Smokehouse Cuban, but on this occasion I opted to try something new to me: The Longhorn.</p>
<p>The Longhorn is a toasted hoagie roll filled with 4River’s amazing brisket and smoked sausage and is topped with a relish, onion rings, and enough melted provolone cheese to sink a small boat. The sandwich is great. It’s not something you can eat every day because, as the menu says, it’s “not for the faint of heart.”  But boy is it good.</p>
<p>Also pictured are the 4R Beans which, are the best beans there is, and the insanely sweet Krispy Kreme Bread Pudding.</p>
<p>I can’t say it enough. If you haven’t been to 4Rivers, then go. If you’ve eaten there before, then go again. And no, they’re not paying me to say this (if they did that would be great), but boy is the food good.</p>
<p>4Rivers can be found in various locations around town.</p>

<p>Orlando is a great city for barbecue fans. There are a number of options for all different styles and tastes. But <a href="http://www.4rsmokehouse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at the top of the list is 4Rivers</a>. 4Rivers opened a few years back on Fairbanks near I-4 but quickly expanded to Winter Garden and Longwood. The original location will be moving down the street this summer to a location over four times as big. There’s no denying that 4Rivers is good. If you haven’t waited in line yet, you need to.</p>
<p>When Carla and I got married in December of 2010, we had 4Rivers cater the rehearsal dinner. It was a great idea. Pans and pans of the good stuff allowed us to eat leftovers for a week. Recently we had family in town, so we picked up a few pans from 4Rivers for dinner.</p>
<p><strong>Meat </strong>(top left): For the family dinner, we got a pan of smoked turkey and another of pulled pork. The turkey is great, not too dry, and carries a lot of flavor. The pork is good too. Not too salty and nicely seasoned.</p>
<p><strong>Beans</strong> (top right): What can you say about green beans? They’re good. But the star of the show are the baked beans. I could eat these things by the gallon if I was allowed too. They are by far the best baked beans I’ve ever had. Sweet, think, a loaded with pulled pork. I actually use the beans as sauce for the rest of their meats. Their sauce is good, but the beans take it to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>Sides </strong>(bottom left): There’s sweet potatoes where are extremely sweet and creamy. There’s nuts of some sort mixed in to give a nice extra texture and flavor as well. Sitting next to them is the macaroni and cheese. It’s creamy and all things bad for you, but very, very good.</p>
<p><strong>Wings</strong> (bottom right): One thing 4Rivers didn’t have when we got married but have now are smoked chicken wings. These things are incredible. Carla said they may even dethrone Korean BBQ Taco Box for best wings in town. The flavor on them is incredible and the smoke flavor really comes through. They’re served dry and as they come they’re perfect, but dipping them in the 4R sauce knocks them out of the park. They’re fantastic.</p>
<p>If you can’t tell, 4Rivers is my favorite barbecue spot in town and is quite possibly my favorite restaurant. It takes bbq to another level and has to be tried to believe. I suggest you head over to 4Rivers now and try everything. But if you can’t decide, try the Texas Destroyer with a side of baked beans. And make sure you ask for the Krispy Kreme bread pudding for dessert.</p>
<p>The original 4Rivers can be found on Fairbanks near I-4. Park in the back and wait in line. It’s worth it.</p>

<p>From time to time we like to get side items from some of our favorite restaurants to help supplement our home cooking. In tonight’s case, mom was making us dinner but added baked beans and green beans from <a href="http://4rsmokehouse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4Rivers Smokehouse</a> to the menu. It was a delicious bonus.</p>
<p>As I told Anonymous earlier this week, 4Rivers is by far my favorite barbecue place in town. We had them cater our wedding rehearsal dinner after all. It’s so good. There’s a number of things on their menu that I really enjoy, but since tonight’s mean was limited to their beans, that’s what I’ll talk about.</p>
<p>If you’ve never had them, 4Rivers baked beans alone are worth the wait in line. They’re very thick, sweet, and have a little bite of spice and are laced with pulled pork. It’s really a thing of beauty. If I’m not careful, I could probably eat the beans by the quart. They’re that good. The green beans are good too, but they’ve got nothing on the baked beans.</p>
<p>4Rivers Smokehouse is at Fairbanks and I-4 in Winter Park.</p>
