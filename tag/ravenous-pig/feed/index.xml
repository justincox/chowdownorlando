<p>Our <a href="http://tmblr.co/Z-OR3xE0ibAW" target="_self">first visit to The Ravenous Pig</a> was over a year ago around our anniversary. We recently found ourselves back there to celebrate a family birthday. Our return visit was just as amazing as the first.</p>
<p>The Ravenous Pig, one of Orlando’s great gastropubs, features a specialty menu that changes at least every month, if not every day depending on what is fresh, in season, and on the chef’s mind. On this particular night, we ended up with quite a sampling of the menu, highlighted by our entrees pictured above.</p>
<p>We started with the homemade pretzels as we had the last time we were at The Ravenous Pig. We’re a sucker for a good pretzel, especially when it comes with a killer mustard. We also started with “The Tacos,” which were battered rock shrimp with all the toppings and an avocado dressing. Killer.</p>
<p>Our entrees, pictured above, included the Pork Porterhouse (first) and the Broken Arrow Ranch Sarsaparilla Venison (second). The Pork Porterhouse was topped with a orange-pomegranate gastrique with florida citrus and walnut compote. Basically a bunch of great toppings to round out the amazing flavor of the pork. This is the largest piece of pork I’ve ever seen served before and, especially considering how large it was, was cooked perfectly, every bite moist and incredibly flavorful. The Pork Porterhouse was also served with beans that were covered with what the server referred to as “magic dust” that took the flavor to another level. The Venison, also perfectly flavored and not gamey at all, was served with mushrooms, spaetzle, and a cherry sauce. My brother called the venison the best dish of the night.</p>
<p>Also enjoyed, but not pictured, was a pork belly and scallop starter. This dish was served with 18th century steel cut oats, vanilla granola, charred strawberries, and a smoked maple syrup which, when combined together, form pretty much the best granola you’ve ever eaten. And that’s before you even try the pork belly and scallop, which themselves are equally amazing.</p>
<p>Our return trip to The Ravenous Pig was a huge success, it’s not like we had any doubts, and it reminded us why The Ravenous Pig is consistently voted one of the best restaurants in Orlando.</p>

<p>First of all, forgive the blurry pictures, I was too excited to start eating.</p>
<p>Four months ago when we started this blog, our <a href="http://chowdownorlando.com/post/8819702634/be-sure-to-put-ravenous-pig-on-your-list-of-places-to" target="_self">very first suggestion</a> was to try The Ravenous Pig in Winter Park. Since then, a number of other people have made the same suggestion, claiming that the Ravenous Pig is one of the best places to eat in the city. Recently, the opportunity arose to join some friends and we took it.</p>
<p>The Ravenous Pig is a gastro pub. I don’t exactly know what that is, but based on our experience I would have to say it’s bar food taken to a culinary level that makes it almost no longer resemble bar food. Did that make sense? Let’s just say a gastro pub is good and leave it at that.</p>
<p>The food. The menu changes depending on the ingredients the chef-owners can obtain, which means that everything is fresh and, as much as it can be, local. We started with the house-made soft pretzels. I’m a sucker for a good soft pretzel with a nice spicy mustard and this appetizer delivered. There was also a nice cheese sauce to dip in as well.</p>
<p>For entrées, I chose the milk-braised pork shoulder with creamy polenta and collared greens while Carla went with chestnut tortellini with scallops, bacon, mushrooms, and squash. Both were delicious, but I have to say, I out-ordered my wife. The pork just fell apart to the touch; a knife wasn’t even necessary. The greens were delicious, even a bit sweet, and the polenta was just amazing. (Also pictured is the shrimp and grits our friend ordered.)</p>
<p>For dessert, we split the eggnog crème brûlée with gingersnap cookies and candied cranberries. The brûlée was nice and smooth and went very well on the cookies. Our waiter overheard a conversation between us and our friends about our wedding anniversary being the week before. He surpassed us by delivering our dessert reading “Happy Anniversary” and then comped it for us. This was very impressive as our conversation was really just an off hand remark. Needless-to-say, this made a wonderful meal even better.</p>
<p>I can now see why so many people recommended we try the Ravenous Pig. While I’m still not quite sure I know what a gastro pub is, I know that the food served is amazing and the wait-staff makes the meal even more enjoyable. This is a new favorite for us and that is really saying a lot.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theravenouspig.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Ravenous Pig</a> is on North Orange Ave, near the intersection with Orlando, in Winter Park.</p>
