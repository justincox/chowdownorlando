<p>We’ve <a href="/tagged/Bem-Bom" target="_self">covered Bem Bom before</a>, but what is not to love with their Portuguese inspired favorites?</p>
<p>Pictured at the top left is the Prego de Porco, which is a 12-hour braised pork that literally just melts in your mouth. It’s topped with a bunch of amazing stuff, including a Bem Bom specialty sauce, and packed between a Portuguese roll – kind of like a softer ciabatta. It is an amazing sandwich.</p>
<p>At the top right was a special of the day, a lamb burger with a homemade tomato marmalade, feta cheese, and a bunch of other good stuff. It was served with the same great Portuguese roll.</p>
<p>Finally, the other special of the day, were the fries cooked in truffle oil and seasoned with rosemary and 24-month aged parmesan cheese. To say these were amazing would be an understatement.</p>
<p>If you haven’t eaten at Bem Bom (Portuguese for “good good”) <a href="http://twitter.com/bembomfood" target="_blank" rel="noopener">then find them tonight.</a></p>

<p>This is the mango painted fish tacos from the Bem Bom truck. When I was reading the menu board, I saw “mango painted fish” and stopped reading. I ordered it without really paying attention to the rest of the description, or the menu for that matter. In fact, I didn’t even realize they were tacos until they arrived. But man, they were good. Bem Bom’s homemade mango habanero vinaigrette pained over a nice white fish, with all the toppings. It provides a nice sweet flavor and then, as you’re swallowing, a nice kick from the habanero. I also went with the nata, egg custard also pictured. It was a nice dessert to close with.</p>
<p>Bem Bom is Portuguese for “good good” and that’s just what their food is.</p>
