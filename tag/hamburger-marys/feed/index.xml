<p>Today is the beginning of beef week here at Chow Down Orlando. We’ll feature three great meals featuring good old beef. Today we look at the special burger for the month at Hamburger Mary’s in Downtown Orlando, the Nutter Butter.</p>
<p>This, like all of their burgers, is a half pound beef patty but this bad boy is topped with a sweet peanut butter and crunchy potato chips. At the waiter suggestion, I also added bananas and bacon to complete the Elvis inspired masterpiece. Oddly enough, all of these flavors and textures work really well together. The burger was pretty delicious.</p>
<p>Being that it’s the burger of the month, I’d venture down to Hamburger Mary’s before the end of August to take advantage of this strange concoction. You’ll be happy you did.</p>

<p>This is Hamburger Mary’s. I’ve heard good things about the food here, but it took us a while to be able to get downtown to try this one out. I’m glad we finally made it.</p>
<p>I ordered the Big Kahuna Burger, which is a normal hamburger with grilled pineapple, teriyaki sauce, and all the normal fixings. I had it served medium rare, which was delicious. It came with a side of fries which were wonderful. We also ordered a side of Mama’s Tatas, but these are just your normal tater tots and we’re nothing really to write home about.</p>
<p>Carla had the Buffalo Chicken dip. This is a natcho dip that is made out of pulled buffalo chicken in a buffalo sauce that packs quite a kick. There’s also crumbled blue cheese in it for added flavor.</p>
<p>We also ordered the Final Cake Fries, which were on the summer menu. These were delicious fries with a little bit of powdered sugar, served with a raspberry jam. At this point we’re both insanely full, but we had to press on and we ate all the fries. It was worth every bite.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a good burger, make sure you give Hamburger Mary’s a try. It’s a little difficult to get to as there’s no parking nearby, but it’s worth the walk.</p>
