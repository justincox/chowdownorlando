<p>We’ve posted about <a href="http://chowdownorlando.com/tagged/Sweet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweet! By Miss Holly</a> before, but it’s fitting to mention that one year ago she made our wedding cupcake cake from her out-of-this-world white raspberry cupcakes. This year we celebrated with eight minis, four white raspberry and the four pictured above.</p>
<p>Pictured from top right going clockwise are Chocolate Mint, White Out, Creamsicle and Peppermint. Peppermint and Chocolate Mint are holiday flavors.</p>
<p>Sweet! By Miss Holly can be found in Waterford Lakes right next to TooJays.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dessert Time! There is one place in Orlando that Justin and I will always visit over and over and over again and that is Sweet! by Miss Holly. Her cupcakes are not only the best I have ever eaten (and that is a very true statement) they are also the most creative. Who new that one of my favorite cupcakes would be made of peanut butter and jelly? Another of my strange favorites would be her breakfast salmon cupcake.</p>
<p><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpyzvhzr9V1qm6c7r.jpg" /></p>
<p>In the picture are some of our afternoon cravings that Justin went and picked up mainly because we needed them. The big one in the middle is my personal favorite: white raspberry. This cupcake is soft and delicate with a surprise of raspberry jelly filling, the icing is covered in sugar crystals and completed with a raspberry jelly bean on top!</p>
<p>Surrounding the giant white raspberry are some of its closest friends: carrot cake, white out, cream-sickle, and peanut butter. </p>
<p>We love Sweet! by Miss Holly so much, that we even had her make our wedding cupcakes!</p>
