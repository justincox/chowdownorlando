<p>I am a big fan of sushi. There is something about eating raw fish that seems so right and so wrong all at the same time. I have to admit, however, that I was slightly skeptical about eating sushi from a food truck (I’m not sure why since there is nothing that I have eaten that came from a truck that I didn’t like). Fish out of Water didn’t disappoint. The only sushi roll I had was the spicy tuna, and it was one of the best spicy tuna rolls I have ever eaten. The fish was perfectly seasoned and topped with delicious sauce. To fulfill my love of potstickers, I had to give them a try too. FOOW has two versions of their potstickers: veggie and pork. I went for pork and had so much fun eating them. They were cooked to perfection and were absolutely delicious. If you love sushi or just want to give it a try, some of the best sushi in town can be found on a truck, just visit Fish out of Water to satisfy all of your sushi needs.</p>
