<p>Last night we went out to dinner for Justin’s birthday to a wonderfully hidden restaurant called Shine Neighborhood Kitchen appropriately located on Shine Ave. I get to be the one posting about it because I definitely out ordered him when it came to this meal, sorry sweetie. In the picture is my wonderful fruitti with muscles, shrimp, and snapper served over a bed on linguini. The wonderful surprise for me was the delicious sauce that it is swimming in. This tomato sauce is more like a broth and has a surprising bite to it which was a fantastic little secret that wasn’t mentioned on the menu.</p>
<p>As an appetizer we had the calamari which, in my opinion, was perfectly breaded and had the perfect amount of sea salt to make you want more and more. If you have not had the pleasure of visiting Shine, that might I suggest planning to go there on your next date night.</p>
