<p>What you see are the three “speciality tacos” from <a href="/tagged/Tako-Cheena" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tako Cheena</a>, the taco concept by Pom Pom. We’ve eaten at Tako Cheena and the verdict still remains, the Panko Crusted Cod (on the left) is probably the best taco in town. I could eat it every single day and not get tired of it.</p>
<p>Also pictured is the Char Siu BBQ Pork taco (center) which is well seasoned and sauce covered pork that just falls apart with each bite. On the right is the Tom Mojo Shrimp taco which is also really good.</p>
<p>As we’ve said many times before, Pom Pom is one of our favorite places in town, and their taco option, Tako Cheena, is another winner.</p>
<p>You can find <a href="http://www.takocheena.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tako Cheena on Mills</a>.</p>

<p><em>Today is the start of Taco Week here at Chow Down Orlando! This is the first of three taco centric reviews coming over the next few days. Don’t forget to <a href="/ask" target="_blank" rel="noopener">submit your favorite taco places</a> for us to check out in the future!</em></p>
<p>It’s kind of hard to make out any unique features from the five tacos, excuse me, <em>takos</em> pictured above with all the cilantro, onions, and cabbage lying about. But below all the green, purple and white lies the good stuff from Orlando’s newest taco house, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tako-Cheena-by-Pom-Pom/174918999187662" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tako Cheena</a>.</p>
<p>Tako Cheena opened a few months back and is run by the fine folks from Pom Pom’s Tea House. They offer a number of unique taco options for all different taste preferences. Carla and I decided to sample five of the seven taco options. From the “House Tako” menu we sampled Thai Peanut Chicken, Indian Yellow Curry with Crispy Tofu, and Asian Braised Beef. From the “Specialty Tako” menu we went with Panko Crusted Cod and Chinese BBQ Char Siu Pork Belly.</p>
<p>I’ll be blunt, skip the House Tako’s all together and stick with the Specialties. The house options aren’t bad, they just don’t leave much of an impact nor carry much in the way of flavor. On the other hand, the Specialty Takos, especially the Panko Crusted Cod, take tacos to a whole other level. Specifically, the Panko Crusted Cod is one of the best taco options in Orlando. The flavors mixed with the crispy fish makes for a very enjoyable experience. So good, I had to order a second.</p>
<p>You can find Tako Cheena by Pom Pom at 932 Mills Ave.</p>
<p><em>Check back into Taco Week on Wednesday when we look at tacos from a place you might not expect.</em></p>
