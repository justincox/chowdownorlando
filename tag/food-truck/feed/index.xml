<p>Meat week wraps up here at Chow Down Orlando with a sandwich featuring classic filet mignon!</p>
<p>Louie’s Bistro, one of our favorite food trucks here in town, featured this amazing sandwich recently. It’s perfectly cooked filet topped with onions, mushrooms, and a homemade béarnaise sauce. The flavors in this sandwich, combined with the quality of the meat, took this sandwich to the level of greatness.</p>

<p>This is the chimichanga from Wako Taco and it’s about the size of my head. I’m not even kidding. In that gigantic fried tortilla is everything you would ever want in a delicious tex-mex concoction including rice, pico, onions, cheese, peppers, pork al pastor, and more things that don’t come to memory. One thing was certain, it was delicious.</p>
<p>The size of it was so big that eating it with your hands was out of the question. This was a chimichanga that called for a fork. Not to mention a monster appetite. Seriously, for the price, this was an unexpected and delicious option from a taco truck.</p>
<p>Their menu sported all the other wonderful things you would expect from a good tex-mex truck, including taco bowls that have to been seen to believe. If you’re looking for stellar tex-mex in quantities that are out of this world, be sure to find the Wako Taco truck.</p>

<p>Fork in the Road has stepped up their game since the last time I visited them. Then it was just quality desserts and some sandwiches, but now the fare is on another level and, according to the menu board, Fork in the Road is the Best Gourmet Food Truck for 2013. The menu was intriguing with a lot of unique options, but what stood out most to me was the American Kobe Beef Corn Dog.</p>
<p>Essentially it’s exactly what it sounds like, a large, quality beef hot dog encased in a type of batter and fried. It was served with a pink mustard that had a sweetness (I’m guessing from whatever colored the mustard pink) that gave the mustard a pretty unique flavor.</p>
<p>All in all it was a pretty good corn dog as far as corn dogs go. You can find <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EatForkInTheRoad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fork in the Road on Facebook</a>.</p>

<p>This is the Summer Cake – lemon cake with raspberry filling dipped in white chocolate – from the Dimples Delights food truck and it’s wonderful!</p>
<p>Dimples Delights is a new dessert truck here in Orlando that opened it’s window for the first time yesterday. Six of these two-bite masterpieces were $5, a steal if you ask me, and offered a few other delicious sounding morsels: banana cake dipped in milk chocolate, her grandmother’s recipe kuchen bread, turnovers, and more.</p>
<p>You can find Dimpels Delights on <a href="https://twitter.com/DimplesDlights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DimplesDelightsLLC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a> and be sure you do, they’re one to look for.</p>
