<p>When it comes to breakfast food, there’s not a lot of room for creativity. Most of it has all been done before. <a href="http://www.theeggandirestaurants.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Egg and I</a> opened in SODO a few months ago offering traditional breakfast favorites in a pretty nice environment.</p>
<p>As I said, it’s hard to really surprise when it comes to breakfast food, though when the apple granola cinnamon pancake I ordered arrived it was pretty surprising. For one, it was huge. The second it was very good and actually was something a little different. It’s your typical pancake, but with apple slices and granola mixed into the batter, then dusted with cinnamon and topped with cinnamon butter. It was actually really good.</p>
<p>When it comes to breakfast, there are a ton of options in Orlando, but The Egg and I serves an area where there isn’t really a lot of options (unless you count Peach Valley, but <a href="http://tmblr.co/Z-OR3xZi92mN" target="_self">we weren’t happy with their service</a>).</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a good breakfast option that might actually surprise you, check out The Egg and I which can be found in SODO.</p>
