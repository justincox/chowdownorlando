<p>Years ago Theo’s Kitchen was located at the corner of Michigan and South Osceola Ave near Boone High School. It was a staple on the corner. Then all of a sudden it was gone, with a sign posted that it was coming to Curry Ford. Strange thing is, six months later a new Greek restaurant opened in Theo’s former location and Theo’s was still nowhere to be found. It did eventually open and has some really good food. <a href="http://chowdownorlando.com/tagged/Theo's" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You can read about it here</a>.</p>
<p>The other day we decided to try the new, well, a few years ago now, Greek place in the former Theo’s location, Mediterranean Blue.</p>
<p>Being creatures of habit, we both ordered what we typically order at Theo’s: a gyro king (normal gyro but with feta cheese as well), stuffed grape leaves, and hummus with peta bread. The first thing I noticed once the food arrived was that the Med Blue peta bread is much thicker and better grilled than the Theo’s version. It’s downright delicious. In fact, the entire gyro follows suit. It’s all well cooked and very, very good. The Greek fries that come with the gyro are equally good. Well seasoned, nice and salty. Just the way good fries should be.</p>
<p>Carla prefers the grape leaves at Theo’s, but I wouldn’t know. That’s not exactly my preferred food option. However, Carla did order a side of rice pudding and could not put it down. She was very tempted to order a second.</p>
<p>All in all Mediterranean Blue is a great choice if you’re in the mood for quality Greek food.</p>
<p>Mediterranean Blue is located at the corner of Michigan and South Osceola Ave.</p>
