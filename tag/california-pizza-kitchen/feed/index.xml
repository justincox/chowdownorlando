<p>For some reason, it took me a long to time to finally try California Pizza Kitchen, although it isn’t as local as I like to eat, I was surprised by just how delicious it really was. It never appealed to me to eat at California Pizza Kitchen mainly because it was a little out of my way to get there and it seemed like a “come-in-sit-down-and-get-out” kind of place. I had nothing to back up these thoughts, but none the less they were there.</p>
<p>I decided to eat there with my mom and my niece when they came down from Virginia to visit and my mind was blown. The atmosphere was wonderful and relaxing, the service was awesome, and the food was delicious!</p>
<p>In the pictures you will see the delicious lettuce wraps that were refreshing and tasteful as well as the pizza that we tried. It is topped with spinach, cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. If you ever eat there let me recommend that you get bacon on your pizza, mainly because the flavors needed a little extra salt and texture and that was the perfect additive. I hope you enjoy your California Pizza Kitchen Experience.</p>
