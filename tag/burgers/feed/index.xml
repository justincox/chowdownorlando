<p>Part two of beef week takes us to <a href="http://bbjunction.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">B &amp; B Junction</a> on Fairbanks in the former 4 Rivers location next to Skycraft. B &amp; B touts a farm to table burger experience. The beef used on this particular day came from a farm in St. Cloud. Pretty cool stuff.</p>
<p>The burgers, as you can see, are on another level. Featured at the top is the #5, a burger with house-made bourbon ham, pecan-smoked bacon, over-easy fried farm egg, and brie on brioche french toast. Topped with a little powdered sugar. This burger is on another level. It’s a Monte Cristo, but it’s not. It’s a burger, but it’s not. It&#8217;s delicious.</p>
<p>Also pictured is the #2, a burger with pecan-smoked bacon, aged cheddar, caramelized onion jam, lettuce and tomato. This is more your standard bacon cheeseburger but the caramelized onion jam take it to a place of esteem.</p>
<p>Fried pickles and onion rings round out or pictures. Just know that when the menu says the plates are “for the table,” they mean it. Five us us had trouble finishing 4 plates of fries, rings, and fried pickles that were “for the table.”</p>
<p>The quality of the ingredients mixed with the amazing taste puts B &amp; B Junction at the top of our burger list here in town.</p>
<p>Really delicious stuff.</p>

<a href='http://chowdownorlando.com/2012/12/weve-been-hearing-a-lot-about-burger-fi-the-new/attachment/290/'><img width="250" height="250" src="http://chowdownorlando.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/tumblr_meu2w7WqNA1r1ujdyo1_1280-250x250.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>

<p>We’ve been hearing a lot about <a href="http://burgerfi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Burger Fi</a>, the new gourmet burger place open on Park Ave, all of it really good. It was only a matter of time for us to get over there and once we saw a picture a friend posted of the logo stamped Burger Fi bun, we were sold. We went the very next day.</p>
<p>When you arrive at Burger Fi on Park Ave, it seems like the perfect Park Ave place – wide open doors spilling out onto a large patio with a ton of tables, all packed with happy people. It’s a good sign. The line was long, but moved ridiculously fast leaving very little time to ponder all the burger toppings. They range from grilled onions to fried eggs, and then some. When we made it to the front of the line, our order was longer than expected because everything sounded so good and, as twitter follower Derek recommended, we went hungry.</p>
<p>We ended up ordering the breakfast burger (burger topped with bacon, eggs, hash browns, and even some maple syrup) and their namesake burger with an addition of grilled onions. On top of the burgers, we went with a basket of Urban Fries which is on the “secret menu” found on the Burger Fi website. These were recommended by friends of ours as simply to die for. They are fries topped with a Parmesan cheese and herb mixtures and covered with garlic aioli. Very good. We also got onion rings, which like Googie Burger in Atlanta, are oversized and amazing. We had also heard a lot about the Burger Fi frozen custard shakes. These are milkshakes without the milk – cream, eggs, sugar – and banana in our case. It was awesome and had straw-sized slivers of banana mixed in.</p>
<p>Overall Burger Fi is a great addition to the Park Ave offerings. The food is fantastic and, honestly, what can be better than eating outside in the sun in mid-December?</p>
<p>Head down to Burger Fi on Park Ave, you’ll be very happy you did. But, like Derek suggested, go hungry.</p>

<p><em>This is another installment of Chow Down Orlando on the road, this time from Atlanta.</em></p>
<p>It’s pretty clear that I’m a huge fan of a messy burger so when we stumbled on <a href="http://googieburger.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Googie Burger</a> in Centennial Park, I had to stop and see what it was. Good thing it was lunch time because this place looked like a winner.</p>
<p>This is the Googie Pig. Think a quality, Five Guys style burger with all the fixing, but tipped with honey-mustard BBQ pulled pork. Absolutely delicious.</p>
<p>Equally delicious were the onion rings which were like no onion rings I’ve ever had. Giant doesn’t even come close to describe the size of these things. Equal to the size is the taste. These things were battered and fried in what tasted like a fried chicken batter which was a completely different taste than expected, but in a really good way.</p>
<p>Googie Burger puts the typical Atlanta burger staple, The Varsity, to shame.</p>

<p>This is Daddy’s Burger from <a href="http://bananasdiner.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bananas Diner</a>. It’s topped with blue cheese, bacon, and caramelized onions (which, if you haven’t figured out by now, I’m a huge fan of). The burger itself was good, though, like most blue cheese burgers, I could have used more blue cheese.</p>
<p>Also pictured are homemade chips, again, I’m a huge fan of. We tried both the cajun and ranch flavors and I enjoyed both.</p>
<p>Not pictured, but worth your time, are Banana’s milkshakes. They’re homemade, huge, and fantastic. I had the Happy Days, which is made from cookie dough ice cream and mini chocolate chip cookies. Crazy good.</p>
<p>One unique thing about Bananas, is that when the bill came, so did homemade banana flavored cotton candy. If you’re going to check out Bananas, make sure you bring an appetite.</p>
<p>Banans Diner can be found in the Mills/50 area, on Mills.</p>

<p>Recently we stumbled upon what might be the best burger place around… in Philadelphia! Consider this the first issue of Chow Down Orlando on the Road.</p>
<p>What you see above is the truffle butter and sautéed mushroom burger found at Sketch Burger in Philadelphia. All the burgers are 8 oz patties cooked to perfection and this one was no exception. It’s a big burger, but with the mushrooms and truffle butter, it was worth every single bite.</p>
<p>Sketch Burger gets it’s name from all the hand drawn ‘sketches’ that cover the walls. There are pieces of construction paper and crayons at every table and guests are encouraged to decorate the walls. It’s a fun place that enhances the crazy good burgers.</p>
<p>We need one of these in the Mills/50 area. Pronto!</p>
<p>If you’re in Philadelphia, you can find <a href="http://www.sketch-burger.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sketch Burger</a> Girard Ave area of Philadelphia. You’ll be happy to you went looking.</p>

<p>This is Hamburger Mary’s. I’ve heard good things about the food here, but it took us a while to be able to get downtown to try this one out. I’m glad we finally made it.</p>
<p>I ordered the Big Kahuna Burger, which is a normal hamburger with grilled pineapple, teriyaki sauce, and all the normal fixings. I had it served medium rare, which was delicious. It came with a side of fries which were wonderful. We also ordered a side of Mama’s Tatas, but these are just your normal tater tots and we’re nothing really to write home about.</p>
<p>Carla had the Buffalo Chicken dip. This is a natcho dip that is made out of pulled buffalo chicken in a buffalo sauce that packs quite a kick. There’s also crumbled blue cheese in it for added flavor.</p>
<p>We also ordered the Final Cake Fries, which were on the summer menu. These were delicious fries with a little bit of powdered sugar, served with a raspberry jam. At this point we’re both insanely full, but we had to press on and we ate all the fries. It was worth every bite.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a good burger, make sure you give Hamburger Mary’s a try. It’s a little difficult to get to as there’s no parking nearby, but it’s worth the walk.</p>

<p>It’s a loosely kept secret that I think the 420 Burger from The Crooked Spoon is the best burger in town since <a href="http://chowdownorlando.com/post/13892287549/carla-posted-about-the-first-church-festival-the" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I’ve talked about it before</a>. But the other day I decided to branch out and try the other burger in The Crooked Spoon arsenal, the one they named after the truck: The Crooked Spoon Burger.</p>
<p>The Crooked Spoon Burger is the savory to the 420’s sweet. This burger packs quality Angus meat, melted swiss, a nice bun, lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions, and a nice chipotle aioli. It’s everything a good, quality burger should be. Like the 420, The Crooked Spoon Burger is served with homemade chips.</p>
<p>So which is the better burger? The 420 has delicious pineapple relish and candied bacon, whereas the Crooked Spoon carries caramelized onions and chipotle aioli. One is sweet and the other is savory. It’s very, very close, but the edge goes to the 420 simply for my love of pineapple on burgers. Otherwise it’d be a complete toss up.</p>
<p>Whichever burger you choose, you won’t be disappointed. <a href="http://twitter.com/TheCrookedSpn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Follow The Crooked Spoon on Twitter</a> and tell me which burger you prefer.</p>
