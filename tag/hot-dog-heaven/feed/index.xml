<p>I’ve been wanting to try Hot Dog Heaven for a long while now. Every time I drive by it’s location on Colonial near the 436 intersection, the giant hot dog sign tempts me. Finally, after years of wondering what was inside, I got a taste of their famous Chicago-style dogs.</p>
<p>Hot Dog Heaven isn’t going to blow you away with flashy choices and gourmet toppings. They’re going to give you exactly what you would expect at a hot dog place: classic Chicago style (pictured), chili dogs, chili cheese dogs, slaw dogs, etc. But what they do, they do very well.</p>
<p>The classic Chicago style is topped with neon relish, onions, tomatoes, peppers, mustard, and on a poppy seed bun. It’s everything I had wanted it to be and then some. I’m a sucker for a good Chicago dog and Hot Dog Heaven filled that craving. Carla ordered the spicy chili dog. There was cayenne pepper worked into the hot dog which she said was a very nice touch.</p>
<p>All in all, Hot Dog Heaven isn’t going to wow you with decor or fancy choices, but what they are going to give you is a really good hot dog.</p>
<p>You can find <a href="http://www.hotdogheaven.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hot Dog Heaven</a> at the corner of 50 and 436.</p>
