<p>Today is the beginning of beef week here at Chow Down Orlando. We’ll feature three great meals featuring good old beef. Today we look at the special burger for the month at Hamburger Mary’s in Downtown Orlando, the Nutter Butter.</p>
<p>This, like all of their burgers, is a half pound beef patty but this bad boy is topped with a sweet peanut butter and crunchy potato chips. At the waiter suggestion, I also added bananas and bacon to complete the Elvis inspired masterpiece. Oddly enough, all of these flavors and textures work really well together. The burger was pretty delicious.</p>
<p>Being that it’s the burger of the month, I’d venture down to Hamburger Mary’s before the end of August to take advantage of this strange concoction. You’ll be happy you did.</p>

<p>The second stop on our north Florida diner tour is Angel’s Dining Car in Palatka. Like Powell’s the other day, Angel’s is a classic diner featuring curbside service and outdoor picnic tables. But Angel’s is something more, it’s actually an old fashioned dining car turned into stationary restaurant. A step inside the dining car feels like a step back in time.</p>
<p>Angel’s has been open since 1939 and features classic diner food like milkshakes, great burgers and onion rings, but also has some unique features like the Black Bottom (pictured with the blue toothpick).</p>
<p>The Black Bottom is hamburger meat, egg, and bacon cooked into a hamburger patty shape to create the ultimate breakfast/lunch hybrid burger. Like Powell’s, Angel’s amazing food comes with prices from days gone by. The Swiss Burger combo pictured, which came with fries and onion rings, was comparable to a combo meal at a fast food place. And considering the quality is far better than any fast food place, you’d be hard pressed not to stop at Angel’s if in the area.</p>
<p>Angel’s Dining Car can be found in Palatka on Reid St.</p>

<p>This week is the North Florida Diner Tour here at Chow Down Orlando. We hit the back roads and visited some of the local gems in some of the small towns north of Orlando. If you find yourself looking for some day trips, there’s some great food to be had.</p>
<p>The first on the tour is <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/powells-dairy-freeze-starke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Powell’s Dairy Freeze</a> in Starke. Powell’s is a classic “dairy freeze” in that there is a walk up window and some picnic tables outside. They also offer curbside service like all classic Americana diners.</p>
<p>While at Powell’s, I tried a banana shake and a “Super Burger.” The shake was real ice cream and chunks of banana. It perfectly made. The “Super Burger” was everything a great diner burger should be: two hand-pressed patties cooked on the flattop, cheese, onion, lettuce, and hand sliced tomato, with some “super” sauce. It was great.</p>
<p>The flavors in the burger and shake were spot on delicious. But when you consider the old school pricing at Powell’s, they’re even better. The shake and burger were under $6. A downright steal.</p>
<p>Powell’s is a true American diner and can be found in Starke on North Temple Ave.</p>

<p>Since today is July 4th, there isn’t anything more American than a good grilled cheese. So today we bring to you <a href="http://igettoasted.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toasted in Winter Park</a>. Toasted opened earlier this year and is everything cheese. They even have a periodic table of cheeses on the wall.</p>
<p>I had a Southern Comfort burger, which is topped with bacon, cheddar, mac n cheese and a homemade bbq sauce. It was great. The burger was cooked to medium and had a nice flavor. Combined with the cheese and the mac n cheese, this burger was plenty cheesy and who doesn’t like a good bacon?</p>
<p>Carla had the Fig &amp; Goat grilled cheese sandwich, which had havarti, fig spread, goat cheese, basil, and honey. It was a great alternative take on the classic grilled cheese.</p>
<p>In an genius move, Toasted sells $1.50 “dippers” of tomato soup which is the perfect size to dip your sandwich into. We also shared a basket of truffle fries, which for $2.50 was a great deal with great flavor.</p>
<p>Overall, Toasted has great flavor for a very reasonable price. You can find them in Winter Park.</p>

<p>This is Daddy’s Burger from <a href="http://bananasdiner.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bananas Diner</a>. It’s topped with blue cheese, bacon, and caramelized onions (which, if you haven’t figured out by now, I’m a huge fan of). The burger itself was good, though, like most blue cheese burgers, I could have used more blue cheese.</p>
<p>Also pictured are homemade chips, again, I’m a huge fan of. We tried both the cajun and ranch flavors and I enjoyed both.</p>
<p>Not pictured, but worth your time, are Banana’s milkshakes. They’re homemade, huge, and fantastic. I had the Happy Days, which is made from cookie dough ice cream and mini chocolate chip cookies. Crazy good.</p>
<p>One unique thing about Bananas, is that when the bill came, so did homemade banana flavored cotton candy. If you’re going to check out Bananas, make sure you bring an appetite.</p>
<p>Banans Diner can be found in the Mills/50 area, on Mills.</p>
