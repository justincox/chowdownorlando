<p>This place was right across the street from the site of the Valentine’s Day Massacre and might have even played a roll.</p>
<p>The food is oversized and delicious. Their “pizza pot pies” are exactly what they sound like. They line a ceramic bowl with cheese and fill it with your sauce (meat or veggie) and toppings choices. I went all the way with Boston butt sausage, whole mushrooms, peppers, and more. They then take the dough and top the bowl, letting it cover the sides and bake it. Table side they flip the whole thing and remove the bowl presenting the pot pie pizza. It’s delicious.</p>
<p>Their other stable are the oven grinders, or gigantic sandwiches. These subs are 11&#8243; long and must be at least 4&#8243; wide and weigh a ton. We went with the Italian ham that was served with a swiss cheese and a pile of green peppers. It was great.</p>
<p>Needless to say there were plenty of leftovers.</p>

<p><strong>On the Road in Chicago: The Little Goat</strong></p>
<p>This place is a hip, modern diner that serves Asian &#8211; American hybrid diner food. It’s run by a Top Chef winner and features dishes with goat meat. Since you don’t see that many places, I figured I had to try. I had a sloppy joe made with goat, an Asian slaw, and homemade brioche bun. Pretty good.</p>
<p>Carla had a “breakfast pasta” which was a giant floating egg with noodles and seafood. And bacon. And cheese. It’s basically everything she loves in this world.</p>
<p>And since there was macaroni and cheese on the menu it had to be ordered. This is super creamy, super rich, delicious stuff.</p>

<p><strong>On the Road in Chicago: Rocket Burger Bar</strong></p>
<p>Saw this place on the Food Network and had to try it. It’s right next to Wrigley Field and features some serious burger options.</p>
<p>I went with the Locavore which touts locally sourced beef, smoked cheese, super fancy onion rings (the waitress said they come laid out in a donut box), bacon aioli, and a pretzel bun. Really freaking good. The onion rings were extremely crisp and the pretzel bun was actually soft in the middle. Plus the smoked cheese added a great bite.</p>
<p>Carla has the Rocket Burger which is made with wagyu beef, brie cheese, date jam aioli, mushrooms, and a red onion brioche bun. Crazy delicious stuff. As expected, this burger is extremely decadent and comes with truffle oil fries.</p>

<p>Giordano’s pizza takes 45-minutes to make so you order before you even have a table. We went with the small (6 slices) filled with sausage and mushrooms.</p>
<p>The cheese and crust were great and there was plenty left over for breakfast the next morning.</p>

<p>That’s a homemade chocolate chip cookie with milk sorbet and blueberry compote.</p>
<p>We also had pineapple pork rib tips, braised lamb, a summer squash and pickled blueberry salad, and a deep fried and stuffed deviled egg.</p>
<p>Great stuff.</p>
