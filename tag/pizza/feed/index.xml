<p>The final stop on our north Florida diner tour isn’t exactly a diner. Though it is found in north Florida and it’s a local diner-like place. It’s <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/lucas-orange-park" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luca’s Italian</a> in Orange Park.</p>
<p>Luca’s offers some amazing Italian favorites, including pizza, calzones, hot subs, etc. Pictured are the Luca’s Special (sausage, pepperoni, onions, green peppers, and mushrooms) with added pineapple and a fried eggplant with spinach and mushroom. If you’ve never had fried eggplant on a pizza before, go to Luca’s and give it a try. It’s amazing.</p>
<p>Continuing our diner theme, the pricing at Luca’s is old school. Monday through Saturday Luca’s has a “lunch special&#8221; where each slice of pizza is $1. These are giant slices too. The pictures don’t give them justice. Two slices and I was stuffed.</p>
<p>If you ever find yourself in Orange Park, stop by Luca’s for lunch and try eggplant on your pizza. You’ll be very happy you did.</p>
<p>Luca’s Italian is in Orange Park on Blanding Blvd.</p>

<p>This is Anthony’s Coal Fired Pizza. It’s “coal fired” in that it’s cooked in a very hot coal fire oven. Pretty straight forward. While I’m not sure we need another “Anthony’s” chain in town, this one has something unique to offer.</p>
<p>The top is cauliflower and the bottom is broccoli rob and sausage. While broccoli rob is an acquired taste, the cauliflower pizza is one of the best we’ve had in a long time. It was incredible.</p>
<p>Because of the extreme temperature the pizza is cooked, the crust is very crispy and, while I’m not usually a fan of thinner crust pizzas, this one was great. Giant slices with mounds of cheese and toppings. It was great.</p>
<p>You can find <a href="http://anthonyscoalfiredpizza.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anthony’s Coal Fired Pizza</a> on Turkey Lake Road.</p>

<p>The Flattery truck in Orlando does one thing and they do it well: flatbread pizzas. They’re all cooked to order in a very cool on board gas fire pizza oven which gives them the very crispy crust. Pictured above are the Swine Not (top) and Thai My Shoes (bottom).</p>
<p>Swine Not is everything that is bad for you but oh so delicious: ham, bacon, prosciutto, white sauce, and caramelized onions. Simply put, it’s amazing. All of that wonderful salty pork make the crunchy crust so. Freaking. Good.</p>
<p>Thai My Shoes is a nice blend of Thai peanut sauce, chicken, and kicked up with Sriracha. It’s very good. The Thai favors all blend very well together and taste great as a pizza.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for some delicious pizza, make sure to give The Flattery a shot.</p>

<p>Every once in awhile I get a craving for good New York style pizza and Gino’s always hits the spot. Located on Orange Ave, Gino’s serves up huge slices of pizza with garlic knots. Pictured is my favorite, the spicy chicken pizza which has just enough heat and spice to make you fall in love with it. My friend had the meat lovers, which as the name implies, has just about any meat you could want on a pizza. I hope you stop in and try some of Gino’s pizza simply because if you are in Orlando there is no other place to get delicious New York pizza.</p>
<p>Gino’s Pizza is located on Orange Ave, right across from The Plaza.</p>

<p>For some reason, it took me a long to time to finally try California Pizza Kitchen, although it isn’t as local as I like to eat, I was surprised by just how delicious it really was. It never appealed to me to eat at California Pizza Kitchen mainly because it was a little out of my way to get there and it seemed like a “come-in-sit-down-and-get-out” kind of place. I had nothing to back up these thoughts, but none the less they were there.</p>
<p>I decided to eat there with my mom and my niece when they came down from Virginia to visit and my mind was blown. The atmosphere was wonderful and relaxing, the service was awesome, and the food was delicious!</p>
<p>In the pictures you will see the delicious lettuce wraps that were refreshing and tasteful as well as the pizza that we tried. It is topped with spinach, cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. If you ever eat there let me recommend that you get bacon on your pizza, mainly because the flavors needed a little extra salt and texture and that was the perfect additive. I hope you enjoy your California Pizza Kitchen Experience.</p>

<p>This is one of our cheaper meals in that one hotdog, two slices of pizza, a berry smoothie and a soda brought us to a grand total of $7 and some change. And where, might you ask, could you get such delicious looking delicacies on a friday around noon? The simple answer would be Cosco. Cosco may be known for their large quantities of meat, produce, and utensils, but you can’t beat their delicious pizza and hot dogs. As you can see from the picture, the food is ginormous! Cosco pizza is definitely one of my guilty pleasures in life.</p>
