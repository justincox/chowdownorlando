				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before starting this blog, there were a few food trucks that my wife and I followed on Twitter with the intention of trying them out. One of them was the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kbbqbox.com/">Korean BBQ Taco Box</a> because, well, if that doesn&rsquo;t just sound like an amazing combination then maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t be reading this blog. One Saturday a few weeks ago we saw through Twitter that one of their four trucks was only about a mile or so from our house and decided to give it a try. I&rsquo;m so glad we did because it&rsquo;s delicious. Tonight, despite the rain, we made our return visit.</p>
<p><img align="right" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/482444/Chow%20Down%20Orlando/Taco.jpg" width="387" height="391.4" />I ordered the bulgogi taco, which is shredded beef cooked with onions and whatever is in their amazing sauce. The taco was good, but not out-of-this-world amazing like their galbi, which is cut spare-rib with onions. That&rsquo;s what I had on our first visit and man is it delicious. The bulgogi is good too, but not the same calibre as the galbi. But what&rsquo;s cool about the Taco Box, is that you just don&rsquo;t get a taco, you get some amazing other little treats: a ginger salad; these fried cheese rolls, which are kind of like little fried cheese sushi pieces; a fried egg omelet, which is interesting; and fried tofu with teriyaki sauce which surprisingly I really like. But the biggest surprise of all is the spicy chicken wing that comes with each box. It&rsquo;s so good that&rsquo;s what Carla ordered tonight, a box of chicken wings&hellip; from the Korean BBQ Taco Box.</p>
<p><img align="right" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/482444/Chow%20Down%20Orlando/Wings.jpg" width="387.2" height="340" />I don&rsquo;t usually like spicy food, but the first time I ate one of their wings the flavor overpowered the heat and I didn&rsquo;t even realize how spicy it was until I started coughing. Tonight I ate the wing that came with my box and two more that Carla couldn&rsquo;t finish before my mouth was burning so much that I had to stop. Well, that and there weren&rsquo;t any wings left.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t tried the Korean BBQ Taco Box, <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/#!/koreanbbq_2011">follow them on Twitter</a> and find out where they are. If they&rsquo;re near you, check them out. You&rsquo;ll be happy you did!</p>
