<p>I love a good burger. And the gigantasaurus burger at Trex in Downtown Disney was one of the best I’ve had in a long time. This burger was cooked to perfection at medium rare and was served with pepper jack cheese on a potato bread bun. It was way to big for me to eat by myself so I split it with my sister. But even eating only half of it I felt like my stomach might explode from the large quantity of meat that was consumed.</p>
<p>As a side we had the waffle fries which can best be described as Chick-fil-a meshed with Arby’s. Needless to say, they were delicious.</p>
<p>Other items ordered at our table were the Mac and cheese (amazing and creamy!), and the queso and chips (eh, it was alright), and the artichoke and shrimp dip (any seafood lover would greatly appreciate this appetizer, but I felt it really could have used more artichoke).</p>
