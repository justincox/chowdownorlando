				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Considering how much we&rsquo;ve eaten and talked about barbecue over the last few days, you might consider this barbecue weekend. Truth is I love barbecue and, as I told Anonymous a few days ago, Orlando has a lot of really good places to get the stuff. Tonight we had an event and had Cecil&rsquo;s cater. There was pulled pork, sliced chicken, baked beans and green beans.</p>
<p>Cecil&rsquo;s pulled pork is more chunks than pulled, but it&rsquo;s not bad. It&rsquo;s not the finely shredded pulled pork you&rsquo;ll find some places, but it&rsquo;s pulled enough to still allow it to melt in your mouth a bit. Their chicken is well seasoned a pretty good. Nicely smoked. But what stands out most about Cecil&rsquo;s is their sauce.</p>
<p>I like wet barbecue. Dry rubs are good to season the food, but I want my &lsquo;cue dripping in sauce. As I do everywhere, I went for the sweet sauce. Maybe it&rsquo;s because their &ldquo;Texas Style BBQ,&rdquo; but the &#8216;sweet&rsquo; sauce even had a kick to it. Not a super strong one, but enough of one to enjoy it. It was good.</p>
<p>Overall, Cecil&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t the best barbecue in town, but in a town with a ton of really good barbecue options, Cecil&rsquo;s is able to stand out near the top. And as a bonus, if you eat in the restaurant they&rsquo;ve got an ice cream machine!</p>
<p>Cecil&rsquo;s Texas Style BBQ is on South Orange just past Michigan.</p>
