<p>Cafe Rouge Express is quickly becoming one of my favorite trucks in town. Their menu is extremely diverse and the food is amazing. On this visit, <a href="http://chowdownorlando.com/post/16934176624/every-tuesday-first-united-methodist-church-of" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they had the Bocadillo Burger I tried last time</a> as well as Carla’s Shepherd’s Pie, but there was also Canadian mussels and escargot! From a truck! I was very tempted to go with the escargot, but knew that I had to go with the whale-sized fish and chips I passed on last time.</p>
<p>Since my last visit, Cafe Rouge was awarded the best fish and chips in Orlando by the Orlando Weekly, and I have to tell you, it’s well deserved. The batter on the massive piece of haddock is very light and extremely crispy. It flakes nicely and provides just the right crunch but doesn’t overpower the fish. It’s served as simply as possible, over hand-cut fries, with malt vinegar, tarter sauce and a lemon wedge. It really is delicious. And considering the whale-sized piece of haddock, I was good for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Cafe Rouge is a must stop in our book and we really hope you try them out. Their food is amazing. You can <a href="http://twitter.com/CAFEROUGEEXPRESS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find them on Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Every Tuesday First United Methodist Church of Orlando hosts food trucks for lunch and calls it <a href="http://firstchurchorlando.org/communicate/food-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trucking Tuesday</a>. This week they hosted Cafe Rouge Express and Fantastic Hummus and, having ate at Fantastic Hummus before, we chose Cafe Rouge.</p>
<p>Cafe Rouge is an English style restaurant in Sanford and Cafe Rouge Express is their food truck. Everything that came out of the truck looked amazing and unfortunately most of the picture I took ended up messed up. But I was able to capture their whale-sized piece of cod in the fish and chips and the Moroccan inspired Bocadillo Burger.</p>
<p>I had the Bocadillo Burger, which was nicely seasoned beef, peppers, onions, cilantro spread, egg and cheese on a bun. At first it was a bit intimidating considering it’s size, but once I dove in all the flavors work so well together. It was really good.</p>
<p>Carla had the traditional Bangers and Mash (not pictured) which was very creamy and good. We also tried the $4 crème brûlée and the $1 homemade Scottish shortbread. At these prices we were tempted to buy them by the pan full they were so good.</p>
<p>Cafe Rouge Express is worth hunting down if you’re in the mood for some really great European food. <a href="http://twitter.com/CAFEROUGEEXPRES" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You can find them on Twitter</a>.</p>
