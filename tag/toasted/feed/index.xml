<p>Since today is July 4th, there isn’t anything more American than a good grilled cheese. So today we bring to you <a href="http://igettoasted.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toasted in Winter Park</a>. Toasted opened earlier this year and is everything cheese. They even have a periodic table of cheeses on the wall.</p>
<p>I had a Southern Comfort burger, which is topped with bacon, cheddar, mac n cheese and a homemade bbq sauce. It was great. The burger was cooked to medium and had a nice flavor. Combined with the cheese and the mac n cheese, this burger was plenty cheesy and who doesn’t like a good bacon?</p>
<p>Carla had the Fig &amp; Goat grilled cheese sandwich, which had havarti, fig spread, goat cheese, basil, and honey. It was a great alternative take on the classic grilled cheese.</p>
<p>In an genius move, Toasted sells $1.50 “dippers” of tomato soup which is the perfect size to dip your sandwich into. We also shared a basket of truffle fries, which for $2.50 was a great deal with great flavor.</p>
<p>Overall, Toasted has great flavor for a very reasonable price. You can find them in Winter Park.</p>
