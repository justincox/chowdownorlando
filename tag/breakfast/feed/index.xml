<p>The <a href="http://www.whitewolfcafe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">White Wolf Cafe</a> is in the antique district near Lake Ivanhoe. Many people have told us we need to check it out, and this morning we finally got over there. We now know why everyone has been telling us to try this place. Simply put: it’s amazing!</p>
<p>We started off with what White Wolf calls the best cinnamon buns in the universe. It did not disappoint and as far as breakfast appetizer go, it’s not to be missed.</p>
<p>Carla had the chicken and waffles. The massive panko breaded chicken breast sat atop a huge belgin waffle. The whole thing was topped with two fried eggs and came with hashbrowns. The chicken was delicious and, with a generous portion of honey covering the whole thing, was a great meal.</p>
<p>I had the special of the day, the five sausage omelet. The crazy-sized three-egg omelet was filled with huge chunks of chorizo, smoked, beef, pork, and turkey sausages and covered with provolone. It came with a super-dense homemade biscuit that was incredible and home fries. The omelet was was out of this world good. Like, beyond amazing good.</p>
<p>While it took us quite some time to finally get over to White Wolf, I don’t suppose it will be long before we are back again.</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="http://www.whitewolfcafe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">White Wolf Cafe</a> on Orange Ave near Lake Ivanhoe in the antique district.</p>

<p>When it comes to breakfast food, there’s not a lot of room for creativity. Most of it has all been done before. <a href="http://www.theeggandirestaurants.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Egg and I</a> opened in SODO a few months ago offering traditional breakfast favorites in a pretty nice environment.</p>
<p>As I said, it’s hard to really surprise when it comes to breakfast food, though when the apple granola cinnamon pancake I ordered arrived it was pretty surprising. For one, it was huge. The second it was very good and actually was something a little different. It’s your typical pancake, but with apple slices and granola mixed into the batter, then dusted with cinnamon and topped with cinnamon butter. It was actually really good.</p>
<p>When it comes to breakfast, there are a ton of options in Orlando, but The Egg and I serves an area where there isn’t really a lot of options (unless you count Peach Valley, but <a href="http://tmblr.co/Z-OR3xZi92mN" target="_self">we weren’t happy with their service</a>).</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a good breakfast option that might actually surprise you, check out The Egg and I which can be found in SODO.</p>

<p>Recently Carla and I found ourselves in downtown Richmond, VA for a wedding. Less than a blocks walk from our hotel was the <a href="http://theurbanfarmhouse.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Urban Farmhouse</a> where we ended up eating breakfast both mornings we were in town and is the latest <a href="/tagged/on-the-road" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On the Road</a> feature for Chow Down Orlando.</p>
<p>Urban Farmhouse is a very cool organic and locally sourced coffee house, market, and cafe. We opted for their special holiday brunch scramble menu, having a combination of the local egg and havarti cheese scramble each morning. One included Virginia ham and the other included soy sausage. Both had rosemary and other great seasonings on the eggs and were served with fresh, local baked bread and sliced apples and pears.</p>
<p>So, the next time you happen to find yourself in Downtown Richmond, make sure to find the Urban Farmhouse and give it a try.</p>

<p>Peach Valley Cafe is the newest breakfast and lunch spot in South Orlando. It’s a very bright and open restaurant where all the servers carry tablet computers that they take your order on. It all seems very fancy.</p>
<p>The issue is that the time it takes to enter all the information into the tablet leaves little time for typical breakfast diner waitress banter. It also means when your order comes out very slowly and then wrong, as ours did, you’re left very confused. Service issues aside, the food is pretty good.</p>
<p>We started with apple fritters which are essentially little apple donuts balls covered in cinnamon and sugar. They’re served with a yogurt for dipping. They’re very good. I ordered a western omelet with potatoes, sausage, and a “buttermilk dropped biscuit.” All the food was tasty and the biscuit was a highlight. There’s butter mixed into the batter and the biscuit is thick and fluffy.</p>
<p>As I said, the food is pretty good and if they can get the service issues in line, I think the place will do pretty well. You can find <a href="http://www.peachvalleyrestaurants.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peach Valley Cafe</a> in the Market at Southside at the corner of Orange and Michigan.</p>

<p><em>This is another installment of Chow Down Orlando on the road, this time from Atlanta.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flyingbiscuit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Flying Biscuit</a> is an Atlanta area chain that is a must stop. It serves breakfast all day along with sandwiches and other favorites. I have never had a bad meal from a Flying Biscuit.</p>
<p>What you see pictured are organic, oatmeal pancakes with a peach compote topping, a chicken biscuit potpie, and a breakfast platter with grits, eggs, chicken sausage, and their famous biscuits.</p>
<p>The thing about the food at the flying biscuit is that it’s just so good. Biscuits are served with an apple cranberry butter that is just awesome. The chicken pot pie has plenty of submerged biscuits to add to the flavor. And the biscuits themselves have just the right amount of sugar on the top to give it that extra something special.</p>
<p>The Flying Biscuit can be found in the greater Atlanta area and, for some reason, in Gainesville, FL.</p>

<p>The Local Yolk&#8217;l is a fairly new food truck here in Orlando that is serving breakfast all day long. Considering you can’t really go wrong with breakfast, this is a great idea!</p>
<p>Pictured at the top is the Hat Trick – three egg, bacon, and monterey jack cheese sliders that had some sort of great sauce on it. These things were awesome. They came served with home fries and was plenty of food for me.</p>
<p>Though because I couldn’t resist, I had to go for dessert and ordered the Chocolate Covered Bacon. I didn’t really know what to expect, but was surprised that the salty bacon didn’t shine through the sweet chocolate as much as it did. It was good. Kind of like chocolate with a crispy, crunchy center.</p>
<p>If you’re in the mood for breakfast, and who isn’t, then <a href="http://twitter.com/localyolkl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">track down the Local Yolk&#8217;l truck</a> today.</p>

<p>We went slightly untraditional for our wedding reception and chose to have brunch at 310 Lakeside, near Lake Eola. We chose this because breakfast is just so good and we thought it would be fun. Simply put, it was.</p>
<p>As part of our anniversary we went back to the scene of the crime, so to speak, and had to brunch at 310. The food there is delicious, so good in fact that we forgot to take pictures of most of it. Not pictured are the salmon omelet and the pear and brie omelet. The only thing left by the time we remembered to take pictures was the french toast. That’s ok though, because I like to save the best to be eaten last.</p>
<p>The french toast at 310 is so good. It’s french bread coated in crunchy cereal and just the right amount of powdered sugar. It’s some of the best french toast I’ve ever had.</p>
<p>310 Lakeside is located on Pine St, right across from Lake Eola. Brunch is served on weekends and they have a full menu the rest of the week.</p>
