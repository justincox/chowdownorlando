<p>Prior to a year or so ago I did everything I could to stay away from sushi. The idea of raw fish wrapped up with rice sounded absolutely unappealing to me. Then I was introduced to the fact that most sushi isn’t actually raw. And now I’m a huge fan.</p>
<p>The reason for my sushi conversion is Bento Cafe in Downtown Orlando. We’ve talked about Bento before, as it’s one of our favorite places to eat in all of Orlando. They have great boxes, but the other day our meal was all about the sushi.</p>
<p>On this trip I ordered my favorite roll on the menu, the Special Mexican (pictured in the foreground of the picture above). The Special Mexican is tempura shrimp, cream cheese, avocado, topped with ebi, eel sauce, and spicy mayo. The crunch from the shrimp mixed with the delicious spicy may make for a really good combination.</p>
<p>Usually I pair this with a Dragon roll, but thought to venture to the other side of the menu on this trip. The back side has all kinds of speciality rolls that, frankly, usually intimidate me. To join the Special Mexican, I added the Bali Hai Mango. This roll is also shrimp tempura, cream cheese, and eel but is instead topped with mango and coconut flakes and then drizzled with eel sauce. Where the Special Mexican has that slightly spicy, creamy flavor from the mayo, the Bali Hai has a sweet and rough texture from the mango and coconut. It was very good.</p>
<p>Also pictured is the sashimi bowl that Carla got. It’s pictured because it’s pretty, but like I said above, it’s all raw and I don’t do raw fish. She really likes it though.</p>

<a href='http://chowdownorlando.com/2011/08/last-night-i-didnt-have-time-to-go-home-from-work/attachment/695/'><img width="250" height="250" src="http://chowdownorlando.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tumblr_lqewv16KFl1r1ujdyo1_1280-250x250.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>

<p>Last night I didn’t have time to go home from work before needing to be back for a meeting so I opted for take-out. Luckily, I work in the heart of Downtown Orlando which affords me proximity to a lot of great food options. Since I needed something relatively quick and exceptionally delicious, I decided to order from <a href="http://www.bentocafeshshi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bento Cafe</a>.</p>
<p>Bento is one of my favorite places to eat in Orlando. It’s relatively inexpensive and just about everything on the menu is great, including the sushi menu. For this particular meal I went with the Pad Thai bento box. A bento box is a small box containing different compartments of food to make a meal. The boxes at Bento come with your entree choice, a ginger salad, sticky rice, noodles, a vegetable, and a small dessert. All total, it amounts to a ton of food and well worth the $8ish price tag.</p>
<p>I’m not entirely sure why I went with Pad Thai last night – honestly it might have been the first thing I noticed on the menu and since I was still at work I wasn’t exactly paying much attention – though over the last few years I’ve probably eaten most of the boxes on the menu. They’re all really good with the Katsu being my favorite. The Pad Thai is good, not too spicy, and with all the other stuff makes a nice meal. I seem to remember there being peanuts on it in the past, but then again I might be thinking of a different entree as well. There’s a lot of them!</p>
<p>Bento is in The Plaza building on Orange Avenue.</p>
