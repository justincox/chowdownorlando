<p><a href="http://muchoorlando.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mucho Tequila and Tacos</a> sits in Downtown Orlando and has a large variety of tacos on the menu. Pictured are the Black and White (if I remember correctly) which was a blackened mahi taco and the Al Pastor, which is marinated pork with pineapple and all the other fixings.</p>
<p>The Al Pastor taco was roughly $4 and the fish taco was pushing $8. When I asked about the large price difference, the waitress told me that the speciality tacos, which the mahi one was part of, were much larger than the normal tacos. So it justified the price difference to me. However, as you can see in the picture, they are the same size. Don’t get me wrong, the taco was good, but it was in no way worth $8.</p>
<p>What was well worth the price, however, was the corn appetizer: Mucho Massa. This is seasoned and flame grilled corn that packs just the right amount of kick. It’s delicious.</p>
<p>If you end up at Mucho, remember that despite the larger price, all the tacos are the same size.</p>

<p>What you see are the three “speciality tacos” from <a href="/tagged/Tako-Cheena" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tako Cheena</a>, the taco concept by Pom Pom. We’ve eaten at Tako Cheena and the verdict still remains, the Panko Crusted Cod (on the left) is probably the best taco in town. I could eat it every single day and not get tired of it.</p>
<p>Also pictured is the Char Siu BBQ Pork taco (center) which is well seasoned and sauce covered pork that just falls apart with each bite. On the right is the Tom Mojo Shrimp taco which is also really good.</p>
<p>As we’ve said many times before, Pom Pom is one of our favorite places in town, and their taco option, Tako Cheena, is another winner.</p>

<p><em>Today is the end of Taco Week here at Chow Down Orlando. It might be the end of the week, but it’s not the end of us eating tacos. Don’t forget to <a href="/ask" target="_blank" rel="noopener">submit your favorite taco places</a> for us to check out in the future!</em></p>
<p>These are the Pork Tacos from the <a href="http://5gastronomy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5 Gastronomy</a> food truck. They may look like your typical taco fare, but these babies take 48 hours to make. The pork is marinated for 48 hours before getting cooked to perfection. But the amazing pork that literally melts with each bite is not the only star of this show. There is so much amazing stuff in these small shells that each bite is a new explosion of flavor.</p>
<p>The tacos are listed to contain smoked corn purée, pickled onions, jicama cilantro salad, creme, and an avocado drizzle. All of these flavors seem like they’re portioned out so that each bite contains a new taste that combines wonderfully with the moist pork. These tacos are legit.</p>
<p>5 Gastronomy is a food track and can be <a href="http://twitter.com/5gastronomy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">followed on twitter</a>.</p>

<p><em>Today is day two of Taco Week here at Chow Down Orlando! This is the second of three taco centric reviews coming this week. Don’t forget to <a href="/ask" target="_blank" rel="noopener">submit your favorite taco places</a> for us to check out in the future!</em></p>
<p>If I were to tell you the picture above doesn’t actually contain grilled chicken, would you believe me? The tacos in question are the Tempeh Tacos at vegetarian friendly <a href="http://www.infusionorlando.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Infusion Tea</a> on Edgewater.</p>
<p>Tempeh is a soy product and, in these wonderful tacos, it’s the star of the show. The tacos are simply constructed with seasoned tempeh, black beans, and cabbage slaw but they pack a great flavor punch. They’re served with blue corn chips and fresh salsa.</p>
<p>As the name implies, Infusion Tea is primarily a tea house. Carla is the tea drinker and enjoys the large variety of flavors from around the globe while I enjoy the interesting menu options. While I’m not a vegetarian, I can enjoy a nice change in the menu from time to time.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a verity of teas or an extensive vegetarian menu, be sure to give Infusion Tea a try.</p>
<p>Infusion Tea can be found at 1600 Edgewater Dr.</p>
<p><em>Come back on Friday when Taco Week concludes with a pair of tacos that take 48 hours to make!</em></p>

<p><em>Today is the start of Taco Week here at Chow Down Orlando! This is the first of three taco centric reviews coming over the next few days. Don’t forget to <a href="/ask" target="_blank" rel="noopener">submit your favorite taco places</a> for us to check out in the future!</em></p>
<p>It’s kind of hard to make out any unique features from the five tacos, excuse me, <em>takos</em> pictured above with all the cilantro, onions, and cabbage lying about. But below all the green, purple and white lies the good stuff from Orlando’s newest taco house, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tako-Cheena-by-Pom-Pom/174918999187662" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tako Cheena</a>.</p>
<p>Tako Cheena opened a few months back and is run by the fine folks from Pom Pom’s Tea House. They offer a number of unique taco options for all different taste preferences. Carla and I decided to sample five of the seven taco options. From the “House Tako” menu we sampled Thai Peanut Chicken, Indian Yellow Curry with Crispy Tofu, and Asian Braised Beef. From the “Specialty Tako” menu we went with Panko Crusted Cod and Chinese BBQ Char Siu Pork Belly.</p>
<p>I’ll be blunt, skip the House Tako’s all together and stick with the Specialties. The house options aren’t bad, they just don’t leave much of an impact nor carry much in the way of flavor. On the other hand, the Specialty Takos, especially the Panko Crusted Cod, take tacos to a whole other level. Specifically, the Panko Crusted Cod is one of the best taco options in Orlando. The flavors mixed with the crispy fish makes for a very enjoyable experience. So good, I had to order a second.</p>
<p>You can find Tako Cheena by Pom Pom at 932 Mills Ave.</p>
<p><em>Check back into Taco Week on Wednesday when we look at tacos from a place you might not expect.</em></p>
