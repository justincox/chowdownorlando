<p>This is actually the second time I’ve eaten at Monsta Lobsta and both times I went with the standard lobster roll. The roll is 4 oz of lobster meat mixed with a bunch of delicious filler. Some people with us were surprised the roll was cold, but I don’t think being cold takes anything away from the flavor. The bun is toasted and very good.</p>
<p>The total package is very good and, despite being the most expensive truck I’ve eaten at, is well worth the cost. Not pictured, Carla tried the lobster lasagna which was a special. Based on her report, she wouldn’t let me have any, it was delicious.</p>
