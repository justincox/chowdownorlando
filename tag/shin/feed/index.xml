<p>A few weeks ago Carla and I were looking for a nice place to eat before going to see <em>Les Miserables</em> at the Bob Carr. We put the question out on Twitter and received recommendations from fellow local bloggers <a href="http://droolius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Droolius</a> and <a href="http://www.eatlocalorlando.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eat Local Orlando</a>. We took Droolius’ recommendation for <a href="http://www.shinsushi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shin Shushi</a> on North Orange Ave. We’re really glad we did!</p>
<p>We started off with Beef Kushi Katsu, which were small, panko battered beef and vegetable skewers. I don’t know if I’ve ever had breaded and deep fried beef before and I’m not really sure why that is because it’s delicious.</p>
<p>Typically Carla is into sashimi and was very tempted to go in that direction. However some of the speciality rolls caught our eye and we went in a different direction for dinner. For our main course, we split three sushi rolls:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Maine (top right roll in the picture): An entire lobster roll tempura fried with some other additions. It was really good and surprisingly light for how large it was.</li>
<li>Crunch California (middle roll in the picture): This was your basic California roll, but tempura battered and deep fried. I had to try it and was very happy I did. It was good, especially when dipped in spicy mayo.</li>
<li>Surf and Turf (bottom left roll in the picture): Tempura battered strip and asparagus inside the roll with seared NY strip steak and a wasabi mayo on top. To say this was one of the best pieces of sushi I’ve ever eaten would be pretty close to the truth. And the best part was Carla didn’t like the mayo on top, so it was all mine.</li>
</ul>
<p>For dessert, we tried the tempura fried cheesecake (who wouldn’t?). It was really good. Basically two entire slices of cheesecake battered and fried (notice a patter with our choices for the evening?) served with a nice ice cream. It was a nice ending to the meal.</p>
<p>We were really happy with Droolius’ recommendation and are now passing it on: If you’re looking for really good sushi, check out Shin on North Orange Ave.</p>
