<p>First off, my apologies since it has taken me forever to actually write about all of the delicious food that you see pictured here. We had an event at our church recently that featured two of Orlando’s Food trucks: The Crooked Spoon and Melissa’s Chicken and Waffles.</p>
<p>Round 1: Appetizers.</p>
<p>Both trucks were setting up and I almost couldn’t contain myself in the waiting for all the prep work to be completed so that I could dig in to some good grub. Finally, the time had come and I was ready to order my first course: 6 cheese mac and cheese from the Crooked Spoon. What I thought would be delicious mac and cheese would be overcome by some of the most delicate and rich pasta I have ever eaten. Made fresh with peppers and basil, this pasta was a force to be reckoned with. I recommend this dish to anyone trying the crooked spoon for the first time.</p>
<p>Round 2: The Main Course.</p>
<p>Next we had two different sandwiches from the Crooked Spoon and nothing other than Chicken and Waffles from Melissa’s. The chicken and waffles was everything you could ever want from a dish: sweet and fluffy waffle, spicy buffalo spiced fried chicken, and a smooth peppery gravy to make it all melt in your mouth. If you have never had the pleasure of having Chicken and Waffles, might I recommend Melissa’s Chicken and Waffles as a good truck to have a great experience. The sandwiches that were consumed from the Crooked Spoon was the Turkey and Cranberry and the 420 Burger. The turkey and cranberry was light and delicious and was a great sandwich to really get me pumped for Thanksgiving, but the star of the show was the 420 burger. This burger was topped with the best accessory for avery meal: candied bacon. I truly wouldn’t mind dying a few years early if I was able to include candied bacon on everything that I eat. And the bacon was just a complement to the perfectly cooked burger. I may say this occasionally, but this time I wish I could make a plaque to deliver to the Crooked Spoon for the best burger I have ever eaten (I want to cry just thinking about the next opportunity I will have to indulge in such bliss).</p>
<p>As a plug for the Crooked Spoon, I would like to announce that they will be downtown! This Tuesday (12/6) the Crooked Spoon will be sitting in front of First United Methodist Church on Jackson and Magnolia downtown serving up some more of their delicious food. Come on down during your lunch break or even for a meeting (there are tables inside). See you there!</p>
