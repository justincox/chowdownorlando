<p>Newly opened in the Plaza downtown is <a href="http://www.le-gourmet-break.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Le Gourmet Break</a>, a classic French bakery and sandwich shop. I had a baguette sandwich with chicken, proscuitto, swiss, salad (greens and tomato), onion, mayo, and a spicy mustard. It was delicious and larger than I expected for the price.</p>
<p>The sandwich has two prices, one for just the sandwich and one for the sandwich and choice of soup, salad, or pastry. I chose pastry. I went with the chocolate, almond, croissant which was roughly the size of my head. I enjoyed half with my lunch and half the next morning for breakfast.</p>
<p>For a bit more than $9 plus tax, this was one enjoyable lunch. You can find Le Gourmet Break in the Plaza downtown.</p>

<p>Since today is July 4th, there isn’t anything more American than a good grilled cheese. So today we bring to you <a href="http://igettoasted.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toasted in Winter Park</a>. Toasted opened earlier this year and is everything cheese. They even have a periodic table of cheeses on the wall.</p>
<p>I had a Southern Comfort burger, which is topped with bacon, cheddar, mac n cheese and a homemade bbq sauce. It was great. The burger was cooked to medium and had a nice flavor. Combined with the cheese and the mac n cheese, this burger was plenty cheesy and who doesn’t like a good bacon?</p>
<p>Carla had the Fig &amp; Goat grilled cheese sandwich, which had havarti, fig spread, goat cheese, basil, and honey. It was a great alternative take on the classic grilled cheese.</p>
<p>In an genius move, Toasted sells $1.50 “dippers” of tomato soup which is the perfect size to dip your sandwich into. We also shared a basket of truffle fries, which for $2.50 was a great deal with great flavor.</p>
<p>Overall, Toasted has great flavor for a very reasonable price. You can find them in Winter Park.</p>

<p>Today is Shop Local Saturday! The goal is to support all the local businesses in the area. We’re doing our part by having lunch at Beefy King.</p>
<p>Beefy King is an Orlando institution. It opened in 1968 and seemingly hasn’t changed since. And that’s a very good thing. They have a simple menu of sliced meat on bread, tots, coleslaw and a pickle. But what they do, they do very well.</p>
<p>Since it’s only two days after Thanksgiving and I’m not yet in a full turkey coma, I opted for turkey and cheese. This is the regular size sandwich, they also offer small and x-large. The regular is just right for me. The turkey is so moist and the touch of cheese is spot on. You can’t really find a better sandwich. Beefy King also offers a vinegar based barbecue sauce, a nice and thick hot sauce, and good old fashioned horseradish.</p>
<p>If you live in this city and haven’t been to Beefy King, you really don’t know what you’re missing.</p>
<p>Beefy King is open for lunch and is located on Bumby, right across from the Colonial Plaza.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Considering I don’t drink tea, it may come across as a surprise that I’m a fan of two of Orlando’s teahouses – Infusion in College Park and Pom Pom’s on Bumby. Carla’s a fan of the tea at these places, but I’m a fan of the food.</p>
<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/482444/Chow%20Down%20Orlando/pompom.jpg" alt="Pom Pom's" width="518.4" height="387.2" align="middle" /></p>
<p>What you see there is the Fu Man Chu, which is Asian pulled pork, watercress, goat cheese, ginger cranberry chutney, and red onions. It’s pretty difficult to put into words what stands out about this particular sandwich because of how great it all works together. It’s creamy and sweet and so very good.</p>
<p>In the background you can see Mama Ling Ling’s Thanksgiving Dinner which is everything you ever wanted in a Thanksgiving dinner, but in sandwich form: turkey, gouda, ginger cranberry chutney, stuffing, mashed potatoes, cream cheese and a side of gravy for dipping! Eating this sandwich I kind of know how Eve felt eating that apple.</p>
<p>On top of the delicious food, the atmosphere is a lot of fun, the staff is very friendly and there’s cool local art on the walls. It’s worth checking out.</p>
<p>Pom Pom’s Teahouse &amp; Sandwicheria is on Bumby between Washington and Central.</p>
