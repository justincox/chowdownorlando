<p>This place was right across the street from the site of the Valentine’s Day Massacre and might have even played a roll.</p>
<p>The food is oversized and delicious. Their “pizza pot pies” are exactly what they sound like. They line a ceramic bowl with cheese and fill it with your sauce (meat or veggie) and toppings choices. I went all the way with Boston butt sausage, whole mushrooms, peppers, and more. They then take the dough and top the bowl, letting it cover the sides and bake it. Table side they flip the whole thing and remove the bowl presenting the pot pie pizza. It’s delicious.</p>
<p>Their other stable are the oven grinders, or gigantic sandwiches. These subs are 11&#8243; long and must be at least 4&#8243; wide and weigh a ton. We went with the Italian ham that was served with a swiss cheese and a pile of green peppers. It was great.</p>
<p>Needless to say there were plenty of leftovers.</p>

<p><strong>On the Road in Chicago: The Little Goat</strong></p>
<p>This place is a hip, modern diner that serves Asian &#8211; American hybrid diner food. It’s run by a Top Chef winner and features dishes with goat meat. Since you don’t see that many places, I figured I had to try. I had a sloppy joe made with goat, an Asian slaw, and homemade brioche bun. Pretty good.</p>
<p>Carla had a “breakfast pasta” which was a giant floating egg with noodles and seafood. And bacon. And cheese. It’s basically everything she loves in this world.</p>
<p>And since there was macaroni and cheese on the menu it had to be ordered. This is super creamy, super rich, delicious stuff.</p>
