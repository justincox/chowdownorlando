<p><strong>On the Road in Chicago: Rocket Burger Bar</strong></p>
<p>Saw this place on the Food Network and had to try it. It’s right next to Wrigley Field and features some serious burger options.</p>
<p>I went with the Locavore which touts locally sourced beef, smoked cheese, super fancy onion rings (the waitress said they come laid out in a donut box), bacon aioli, and a pretzel bun. Really freaking good. The onion rings were extremely crisp and the pretzel bun was actually soft in the middle. Plus the smoked cheese added a great bite.</p>
<p>Carla has the Rocket Burger which is made with wagyu beef, brie cheese, date jam aioli, mushrooms, and a red onion brioche bun. Crazy delicious stuff. As expected, this burger is extremely decadent and comes with truffle oil fries.</p>

<p><strong>On the Road in Chicago: Giordano’s</strong></p>
<p>You can’t really go to Chicago and not have Chicago style pizza and, from my Chicago-area friends, this was the place to go.</p>
<p>Giordano’s pizza takes 45-minutes to make so you order before you even have a table. We went with the small (6 slices) filled with sausage and mushrooms.</p>
<p>The cheese and crust were great and there was plenty left over for breakfast the next morning.</p>

<p>We also had pineapple pork rib tips, braised lamb, a summer squash and pickled blueberry salad, and a deep fried and stuffed deviled egg.</p>

<p>Part two of beef week takes us to <a href="http://bbjunction.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">B &amp; B Junction</a> on Fairbanks in the former 4 Rivers location next to Skycraft. B &amp; B touts a farm to table burger experience. The beef used on this particular day came from a farm in St. Cloud. Pretty cool stuff.</p>
<p>The burgers, as you can see, are on another level. Featured at the top is the #5, a burger with house-made bourbon ham, pecan-smoked bacon, over-easy fried farm egg, and brie on brioche french toast. Topped with a little powdered sugar. This burger is on another level. It’s a Monte Cristo, but it’s not. It’s a burger, but it’s not. It&#8217;s delicious.</p>
<p>Also pictured is the #2, a burger with pecan-smoked bacon, aged cheddar, caramelized onion jam, lettuce and tomato. This is more your standard bacon cheeseburger but the caramelized onion jam take it to a place of esteem.</p>
<p>Fried pickles and onion rings round out or pictures. Just know that when the menu says the plates are “for the table,” they mean it. Five us us had trouble finishing 4 plates of fries, rings, and fried pickles that were “for the table.”</p>
<p>The quality of the ingredients mixed with the amazing taste puts B &amp; B Junction at the top of our burger list here in town.</p>
<p>Really delicious stuff.</p>

<p>Today is the beginning of beef week here at Chow Down Orlando. We’ll feature three great meals featuring good old beef. Today we look at the special burger for the month at Hamburger Mary’s in Downtown Orlando, the Nutter Butter.</p>
<p>This, like all of their burgers, is a half pound beef patty but this bad boy is topped with a sweet peanut butter and crunchy potato chips. At the waiter suggestion, I also added bananas and bacon to complete the Elvis inspired masterpiece. Oddly enough, all of these flavors and textures work really well together. The burger was pretty delicious.</p>
<p>Being that it’s the burger of the month, I’d venture down to Hamburger Mary’s before the end of August to take advantage of this strange concoction. You’ll be happy you did.</p>

<p><a href="http://muchoorlando.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mucho Tequila and Tacos</a> sits in Downtown Orlando and has a large variety of tacos on the menu. Pictured are the Black and White (if I remember correctly) which was a blackened mahi taco and the Al Pastor, which is marinated pork with pineapple and all the other fixings.</p>
<p>The Al Pastor taco was roughly $4 and the fish taco was pushing $8. When I asked about the large price difference, the waitress told me that the speciality tacos, which the mahi one was part of, were much larger than the normal tacos. So it justified the price difference to me. However, as you can see in the picture, they are the same size. Don’t get me wrong, the taco was good, but it was in no way worth $8.</p>
<p>What was well worth the price, however, was the corn appetizer: Mucho Massa. This is seasoned and flame grilled corn that packs just the right amount of kick. It’s delicious.</p>
<p>If you end up at Mucho, remember that despite the larger price, all the tacos are the same size.</p>

<p>The final stop on our north Florida diner tour isn’t exactly a diner. Though it is found in north Florida and it’s a local diner-like place. It’s <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/lucas-orange-park" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luca’s Italian</a> in Orange Park.</p>
<p>Luca’s offers some amazing Italian favorites, including pizza, calzones, hot subs, etc. Pictured are the Luca’s Special (sausage, pepperoni, onions, green peppers, and mushrooms) with added pineapple and a fried eggplant with spinach and mushroom. If you’ve never had fried eggplant on a pizza before, go to Luca’s and give it a try. It’s amazing.</p>
<p>Continuing our diner theme, the pricing at Luca’s is old school. Monday through Saturday Luca’s has a “lunch special&#8221; where each slice of pizza is $1. These are giant slices too. The pictures don’t give them justice. Two slices and I was stuffed.</p>
<p>If you ever find yourself in Orange Park, stop by Luca’s for lunch and try eggplant on your pizza. You’ll be very happy you did.</p>
<p>Luca’s Italian is in Orange Park on Blanding Blvd.</p>

<p>The second stop on our north Florida diner tour is Angel’s Dining Car in Palatka. Like Powell’s the other day, Angel’s is a classic diner featuring curbside service and outdoor picnic tables. But Angel’s is something more, it’s actually an old fashioned dining car turned into stationary restaurant. A step inside the dining car feels like a step back in time.</p>
<p>Angel’s has been open since 1939 and features classic diner food like milkshakes, great burgers and onion rings, but also has some unique features like the Black Bottom (pictured with the blue toothpick).</p>
<p>The Black Bottom is hamburger meat, egg, and bacon cooked into a hamburger patty shape to create the ultimate breakfast/lunch hybrid burger. Like Powell’s, Angel’s amazing food comes with prices from days gone by. The Swiss Burger combo pictured, which came with fries and onion rings, was comparable to a combo meal at a fast food place. And considering the quality is far better than any fast food place, you’d be hard pressed not to stop at Angel’s if in the area.</p>
<p>Angel’s Dining Car can be found in Palatka on Reid St.</p>
